MIDDLE FINGER


The middle finger, long finger, or tall finger is the third digit of the human hand, located between the index finger and the ring finger. 

It is typically the longest digit. 

In anatomy, it is also called the third finger, digitus medius, digitus tertius or digitus III.
In Western countries, extending the middle finger (either by itself, or along with the index finger in the United Kingdom: see V sign) is an offensive and obscene gesture, widely recognized as a form of insult, due to its resemblance of an erect penis, It is known, colloquially, as "flipping the bird", "flipping (someone) off", or "giving (someone) the finger". 

Similarly, one may extend the middle, ring and pointer fingers to someone and say "read between the lines."The middle finger is often used for finger snapping together with the thumb.
