CAROTID SINUS NERVE


The carotid branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (carotid sinus nerve or Hering's nerve) is a small branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve that innervates the carotid sinus and carotid body. 

It is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve that runs downwards, anterior to the internal carotid artery. 

It communicates with the vagus nerve and sympathetic trunk and then divides in the angle of the bifurcation of the common carotid artery to innervate the carotid body and carotid sinus. 

It carries impulses from the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus to the vasomotor center in the brainstem (to help maintain a more consistent blood pressure) and from chemoreceptors in the carotid body (mainly monitoring blood gas PaO2 and PaCO2 levels).
