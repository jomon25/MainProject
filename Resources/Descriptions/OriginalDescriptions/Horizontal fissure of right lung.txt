HORIZONTAL FISSURE OF RIGHT LUNG


The right lung is divided into three lobes by a horizontal fissure, and an oblique fissure. 

The horizontal fissure separates the upper and middle lobes of right lung.

The fissures are formed in early prenatal development by invaginations of the visceral pleura that divide the lobar bronchi, and section the lungs into lobes that helps in their expansion.
