INFERIOR TRUNK OF BRACHIAL PLEXUS


==Trunks==

These roots merge to form the trunks:

    Superior trunk of brachial plexus (C5-C6)
    Middle trunk of brachial plexus (C7)
    Inferior trunk of brachial plexus (C8, T1)


==Divisions==

Each trunk then splits in two, to form six divisions:

    -Anterior divisions of the upper, middle, and inferior trunks
    -and posterior divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunks
    when observing the body in the anatomical position, the anterior divisions are superficial to the posterior divisions


==Cords==

These six divisions regroup to become the three cords or large fiber bundles. 

The cords are named by their position with respect to the axillary artery.

    The posterior cord is formed from the three posterior divisions of the trunks (C5-C8, T1)
    The lateral cord is formed from the anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks (C5-C7)
    The medial cord is simply a continuation of the anterior division of the lower trunk (C8, T1)
