MEMBRANOUS PART OF NASAL SEPTUM


The fleshy external end of the nasal septum is called the columella or columella nasi, and is made up of cartilage and soft tissue.

The nasal septum contains bone and hyaline cartilage.

It is normally about 2 mm thick.

The nasal septum is composed of four structures:

    Perpendicular plate of ethmoid bone
    Vomer bone
    Septal nasal cartilage
    Maxillary bone (the crest)

The lowest part of the septum is a narrow strip of bone that projects from the maxilla and the palatine bones, and is the length of the septum.

This strip of bone is called the maxillary crest; it articulates in front with the quadrangular cartilage, and at the back with the vomer.

The maxillary crest is described in the anatomy of the nasal septum as having a maxillary component and a palatine component.
