PYLORIC ANTRUM


The pyloric antrum is the initial portion of the pylorus. 

It is near the bottom of the stomach, proximal to the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the duodenum. 

It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the pyloric canal by a slight groove.
