TALOCALCANEONAVICULAR JOINT


The talocalcaneonavicular joint is a ball and socket joint: the rounded head of the talus being received into the concavity formed by the posterior surface of the navicular, the anterior articular surface of the calcaneus, and the upper surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament.


== structure ==

As the shape of this joint suggests this joint is a synovial Ball-and-socket joint it is composed of unique articular surfaces they are:
1-The articulation between the medial talar articular surface on the sustentaculum tali of the superior Calcaneus and the corresponding inferior facet of the Talus neck 
2-The articulation between the anterior talar articular facet of the superior calcaneus and the anterior facet of the corresponding inferior talar head 
3-The articulation between the articular surface of Navicular and the head of talus (some might refer to this articulation alone as a talonavicular joint)
Ligaments
The whole talus is kind of sitting on the Plantar calcaneonavicular ligament as it extends inferior to the talus attaching to the anterior aspect of sustentaculum tali to the plantar surface of navicular so by beginning from sustentaculum tali it covers the plantar surface of the middle and anterior articulations between the calcaneus and talus and by attaching to the navicular it clearly also covers the articulation between the talus and navicular this is a reason why the medial longitudinal arch of the foot is a bit higher than the lateral longitudinal arch of the foot as this ligament is a main part of it 
The calcaneonavicular part of the Bifurcated ligament by extending from the dorsolateral side of calcaneus (near the tarsal sinus) to lateral side of the navicular it reinforces the joint particularly laterally where the head of the talus articulates with the articular facet of navicular this ligament keeps it all tightly tied together and maintain the shape of ball and socket 
The dorsal talonavicular ligament extends from the dorsal aspect of the foot from the neck of the talus to the navicular 
The socket of this joint is formed by the concave articular facets of navicular,calcaneus,calcaneonavicular part of bifurcate ligament and the spring ligament (plantar calcaneonavicular ligament) where as the ball is formed by the convex talus
