INFERIOR PUBIC LIGAMENT




SUPERIOR PUBIC LIGAMENT


The superior pubic ligament and the inferior pubic ligament provide stability to the pubic symphysis; the anterior and posterior ligaments are weaker. 

The inferior ligament in the pubic arch is also known as the arcuate pubic ligament or subpubic ligament; it is a thick, triangular arch of ligamentous fibers, connecting together the two pubic bones below, and forming the upper boundary of the pubic arch. 

Below, it is free, and is separated from the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm by an opening through which the deep dorsal vein of the penis passes into the pelvis.
