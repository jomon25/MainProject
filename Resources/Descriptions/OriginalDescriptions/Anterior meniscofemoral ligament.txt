ANTERIOR MENISCOFEMORAL LIGAMENT


The anterior meniscofemoral ligament (ligament of Humphry) is a small fibrous band of the knee joint. 

It arises from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus and passes superiorly and medially in front of the posterior cruciate ligament to attach to the lateral surface of medial condyle of the femur.
It may be confused for the posterior cruciate ligament during arthroscopy. 

In this situation, a tug on the ligament while observing for motion of the lateral meniscus can be used to tell the two apart.
