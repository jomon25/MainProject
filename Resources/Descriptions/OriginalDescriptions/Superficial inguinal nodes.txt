SUPERFICIAL INGUINAL NODES


The superficial inguinal lymph nodes are the inguinal lymph nodes that form a chain immediately below the inguinal ligament. 
    
They lie deep to the fascia of Camper that overlies the femoral vessels at the medial aspect of the thigh. 

They are bounded superiorly by the inguinal ligament in the femoral triangle; laterally by the border of the sartorius muscle, and medially by the adductor longus muscle.

They are divided into three groups:

    -inferior – inferior of the saphenous opening of the leg, receive drainage from lower legs
    
    -superolateral – on the side of the saphenous opening, receive drainage from the side buttocks and the lower abdominal wall.
    
    -superomedial – located at the middle of the saphenous opening, take drainage from the perineum and genitals.

There are approximately ten superficial lymph nodes, and they drain to the deep inguinal lymph nodes. 

Inguinal lymph nodes may normally be up to 2 cm in size.

They receive lymphatic afferents from the following:

    -integument of the penis
    -scrotum
    -perineum
    -buttock
    -abdominal wall below the level of the umbilicus
    -back below the level of the iliac crest
    -vulva
    -anus (below the pectinate line)
    -the thigh and the medial side of the leg (the lateral leg drains to the popliteal lymph nodes first).
