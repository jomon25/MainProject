UTEROSACRAL LIGAMENT


The uterosacral ligaments (or rectouterine ligaments) belong to the major ligaments of uterus.


== Structure ==

The rectouterine folds contain a considerable amount of fibrous tissue and non-striped muscular fibers which are attached to the front of the sacrum and constitute the uterosacral ligaments.These ligaments travel from the uterus to the anterior aspect of the sacrum.The pelvic splanchnic nerves run on top of the ligament.
