MEDIAN ATLANTO-AXIAL JOINT


There are three atlanto-axial joints: one median and two lateral:

    The median atlanto-axial joint is sometimes considered a triple joint:
        
        -one between the posterior surface of the anterior arch of atlas and the front of the odontoid process
        
        -one between the anterior surface of the ligament and the back of the odontoid process
