SUPERIOR GLUTEAL VEINS


The superior gluteal veins (gluteal veins) are ven√¶ comitantes of the superior gluteal artery; they receive tributaries from the buttock corresponding with the branches of the artery, and enter the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, above the piriformis, and frequently unite before ending in the hypogastric vein (internal iliac vein).
