MALE EXTERNAL GENITALIA


The male reproductive system is a series of organs located outside of the body and around the pelvic region of a male that contribute towards the reproduction process. 

The primary direct function of the male reproductive system is to provide the male sperm for fertilization of the ovum.

The major reproductive organs of the male can be grouped into three categories. 

The first category is sperm production and storage. 

Production takes place in the testes which are housed in the temperature regulating scrotum, immature sperm then travel to the epididymis for development and storage. 

The second category is the ejaculatory fluid-producing glands which include the seminal vesicles, prostate, and the vas deferens. 

The final category are those used for copulation, and deposition of the spermatozoa (sperm) within the male, these include the penis, urethra, vas deferens, and Cowper's gland.

Major secondary sex characteristics include larger, more muscular stature, deepened voice, facial and body hair, broad shoulders, and development of an Adam's apple. An important sexual hormone of males is androgen, and particularly testosterone.

The testes release a hormone that controls the development of sperm. 

This hormone is also responsible for the development of physical characteristics in men such as facial hair and a deep voice.
