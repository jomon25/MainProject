LATERAL SEMICIRCULAR CANAL


The lateral semicircular canal also called horizontal canal or external semicircular canal, is the shortest of the three canals. 

Movement of fluid within this canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis (i.e. the neck), or in other words rotation in the transverse plane. 

This occurs, for example, when one turns the head from side to side.

It measures from 12 to 15 mm (0.47 to 0.59 in), and its arch is directed horizontally backward and laterally; thus each semicircular canal stands at right angles to the other two. 

Its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and lateral angle of the vestibule, just above the oval window, where it opens close to the ampullated end of the superior canal; its opposite end opens at the upper and back part of the vestibule. 

The lateral canal of one ear is very nearly in the same plane as that of the other.
