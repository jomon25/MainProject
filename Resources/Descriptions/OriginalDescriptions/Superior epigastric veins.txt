It runs deep to the rectus abdominis muscle. 

It anastomoses with the inferior epigastric vein at the level of the umbilicus. 

Along its course, it is accompanied by a similarly named artery, the superior epigastric artery.

The superior epigastric vein helps to drain the anterior part of the abdominal wall. 

It may also drain part of the diaphragm.
