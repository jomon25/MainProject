PARS INTERMEDIA OF HYPOPHYSIS


The anterior lobe of the pituitary can be divided into the pars tuberalis of hypophysis (pars glandularis) and pars distalis of hypophysis (pars glandularis) that constitutes ~80% of the gland. 

The pars intermedia (the intermediate lobe) lies between the pars distalis and the pars tuberalis, and is rudimentary in the human, although in other species it is more developed.

It develops from a depression in the dorsal wall of the pharynx (stomal part) known as Rathke's pouch.
