TUBERCLE OF RIB



A tubercle of rib on the posterior surface of the neck of the rib, has two facets (surfaces) one articulating and one non-articulating. 

The articular facet, is small and oval and is the lower and more medial of the two, and connects to the transverse costal facet on the thoracic vertebra of the same rib number. 

The transverse costal facet is on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which the head is connected. 

The non-articular portion is a rough elevation and affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. 

The tubercle is much more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.
