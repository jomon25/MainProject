CRICOTHYROID JOINT


The cricothyroid joint (or articulation) is a joint connecting the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid cartilage. 

It plays a key role in adjusting human voice pitch by changing the tension of the vocal cords. 

This tension is controlled mostly by the endolaryngeal vocalis and the extralaryngeal cricothyroid muscles which change vocal fold tension by narrowing the cricothyroid space created by rotation and gliding movements in horizontal and vertical direction allowed for by the cricothyroid articulation.
