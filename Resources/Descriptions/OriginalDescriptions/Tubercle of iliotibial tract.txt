TUBERCLE OF ILIOTIBIAL TRACT

On the lateral condyle of femur, the tubercle of iliotibial tract gives attachment to the iliotibial tract, that connects the tibia to the anterolateral iliac tubercle portion of the external lip of the iliac crest.
 
The iliotibial band (ITB) is a thick band of fascia formed proximally at the hip by the fascia of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. 

Its main functions are pelvic stabilisation and posture control.
