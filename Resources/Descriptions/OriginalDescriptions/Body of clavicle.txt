BODY OF CLAVICLE


The shaft or body of the clavicle is divided into two main regions, the medial region, and the lateral region. 

The medial region is also known as the sternal region, it is the longest clavicular region as it takes up two-thirds of the entire shaft. 

The lateral region is also known as the acromial region, it is both the widest clavicular region and thinnest clavicular region.

The lateral region of the shaft has two borders and two surfaces.

    -the anterior border is concave forward and gives origin to the deltoid muscle.
    -the posterior border is convex and gives attachment to the trapezius muscle.
    -the inferior surface has a ridge called the trapezoid line and a tubercle; the conoid tubercle for attachment with the trapezoid and the conoid ligament, part of the coracoclavicular ligament that serves to connect the collarbone with the coracoid process of the scapula.
