DORSAL PARTS OF LATERAL INTERTRANSVERSARII LUMBORUM MUSCLES


In the lumbar region the intertransversarii lumborum muscles are arranged in pairs, on either side of the vertebral column.

One set occupying the entire interspace between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, are the Lateral intertransversarii lumborum muscles.
    
Each lateral intertransversarius muscle in the lumbar region can be further subdivided into an anterior and posterior division. 

The posterior division courses from the accessory process of the vertebra above to the transverse process of the vertebra below. 

Both the anterior and posterior divisions of the lateral intertransversarii muscles are innervated by lumbar anterior primary divisions (ventral rami).
