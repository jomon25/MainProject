SUBMENTAL NODES


The submental glands (or suprahyoid) are situated between the anterior bellies of the digastric muscle and the hyoid bone.

Their afferents drain the central portions of the lower lip and floor of the mouth and the apex of the tongue.

Their efferents pass partly to the submandibular lymph nodes and partly to a gland of the deep cervical group situated on the internal jugular vein at the level of the cricoid cartilage.
