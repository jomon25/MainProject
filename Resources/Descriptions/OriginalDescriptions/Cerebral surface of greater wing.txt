CEREBRAL SURFACE OF GREATER WING


The superior or cerebral surface of each greater wing forms part of the middle cranial fossa; it is deeply concave, and presents depressions for the convolutions of the temporal lobe of the brain. 

It has a number of foramina (holes) in it:

    The foramen rotundum is a circular aperture at its anterior and medial part; it transmits the maxillary nerve.
    
    The foramen ovale is behind and lateral to this; it transmits the mandibular nerve, the accessory meningeal artery, and sometimes the lesser petrosal nerve.
    
    The sphenoidal emissary foramen is occasionally present; it is a small aperture medial to the foramen ovale, opposite the root of the pterygoid process; it opens below near the scaphoid fossa, and transmits a small vein from the cavernous sinus.
    
    The foramen spinosum, in the posterior angle near to and in front of the spine; it is a short canal that transmits the middle meningeal vessels and a recurrent branch from the mandibular nerve.
    
    The foramen petrosum, a small occasional opening, between the foramen spinosum and foramen ovale, for transmission of the lesser petrosal nerve.
