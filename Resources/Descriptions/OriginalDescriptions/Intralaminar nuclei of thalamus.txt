INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI OF THALAMUS


The intralaminar nuclei are collections of neurons in the thalamus that are generally divided in two groups as follows:
anterior (rostral) group
central medial nucleus
paracentral nucleus
central lateral nucleus
posterior (caudal) intralaminar group
centromedian nucleus
parafascicular nucleusSome sources also include a "central dorsal" nucleus.
Degeneration of this area can be associated with progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease.
