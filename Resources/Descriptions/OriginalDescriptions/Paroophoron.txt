PAROOPHORON


The paroophoron (of Johnson) consists of a few scattered rudimentary tubules, best seen in the child, situated in the broad ligament between the epo√∂phoron and the uterus. 

Named for the Welsh anatomist David Johnson who originally described the structure at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.
It is a remnant of the mesonephric tubules.
