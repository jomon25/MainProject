NINTH THORACIC VERTEBRA


The ninth thoracic vertebra may have no demi-facets below. 

In some subjects however, it has two demi-facets on either side; when this occurs the tenth doesn't have facets but demi-facets at the upper part.

The thoracic spinal nerve 9 (T9) passes out underneath it.

The xiphisternum (or xiphoid process of the sternum) is at the same level in the axial plane.
