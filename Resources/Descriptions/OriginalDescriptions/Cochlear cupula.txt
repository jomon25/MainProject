COCHLEAR CUPULA


The cochlear cupula is a structure in the cochlea. 

It is the apex of the cochlea.
The bony canal of the cochlea takes two and three-quarter turns around the modiolus. 

The modiolus is about 30 mm in length, and diminishes gradually in diameter from the base to the summit, where it terminates in the cupula.
