INFERIOR VESICAL ARTERY


The inferior vesical artery or inferior vesicle artery is an artery in the pelvis that supplies the lower part of the bladder.


== Structure ==

The inferior vesical artery is a branch (direct or indirect) of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. 

It frequently arises in common with the middle rectal artery, and is distributed to the fundus of the bladder. 

In males, it also supplies the prostate and the seminal vesicles. 

The branches to the prostate communicate with the corresponding vessels of the opposite side.


=== Sex ===

Some texts consider it to be found only in males, and cite the vaginal artery as the homologous structure in females.Other texts consider it to be present in both males and females. 

In these contexts, the inferior vesical artery in females is a small branch of a vaginal artery.
