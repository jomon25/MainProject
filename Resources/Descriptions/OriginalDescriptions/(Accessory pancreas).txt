(ACCESSORY PANCREAS)


Accessory pancreas is a rare condition in which small groups of pancreatic cells are separate from the pancreas. 

They may occur in the mesentery of the small intestine, the wall of the duodenum, the upper part of the jejunum, or more rarely, in the wall of the stomach, ileum, gallbladder or spleen.
