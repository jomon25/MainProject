ARCUATE POPLITEAL LIGAMENT


The arcuate popliteal ligament is an extracapsular ligament of the knee. 

It is Y-shaped and is attached to the posterior portion of the head of the fibula. 

From there it goes to its two insertions; the medial one goes over popliteus muscle and blends with the oblique popliteal ligament, the lateral one to the Lateral epicondyle of the femur and blends there with the lateral head of gastrocnemius muscle.
