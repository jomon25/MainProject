FIFTH THORACIC VERTEBRA


The fifth thoracic vertebra, together with the fourth, is at the same level as the sternal angle. 

The human trachea divides into two main bronchi at the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra, but may also end higher or lower, depending on breathing. 

The thoracic spinal nerve 5 (T5) passes out underneath it.
