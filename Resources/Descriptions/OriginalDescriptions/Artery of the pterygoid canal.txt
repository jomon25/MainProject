ARTERY OF THE PTERYGOID CANAL


The artery of the pterygoid canal (or Vidian artery) is an artery in the pterygoid canal, in the head.
It usually arises from the external carotid artery, but can arise from either the internal or external carotid artery or serve as an anastomosis between the two.The eponym, Vidian artery, is derived from the Italian surgeon and anatomist Vidus Vidius.


== From external carotid artery ==

In this case; the artery passes backward along the pterygoid canal with the corresponding nerve. 

It is distributed to the upper part of the pharynx and to the auditory tube, sending into the tympanic cavity a small branch which anastomoses with the other tympanic arteries.
It can end in the oropharynx.


== From internal carotid artery ==

In this case; the artery passes backward along the pterygoid canal with the corresponding nerve. 

The artery is a small, inconstant branch which passes into the pterygoid canal and anastomoses with a pterygopalatine branch of the maxillary artery.
