LEFT CORONARY LEAFLET


The two leaflets of the aortic valve that are attached to the (interventricular?) septum are named the left and right leaflets, and correspond to the right and left leaflets of the aortic valve, which they face. 

The third leaflet is called the anterior leaflet or the non-coronary leaflet (to maintain the nomenclature of the aortic valve).
