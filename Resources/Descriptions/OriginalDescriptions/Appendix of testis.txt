APPENDIX OF TESTIS


The appendix testis (or hydatid of Morgagni) is a vestigial remnant of the Müllerian duct, present on the upper pole of the testis and attached to the tunica vaginalis. 

It is present about 90% of the time.


== Clinical significance ==



=== Torsion ===

The appendix of testis can, occasionally, undergo torsion (i.e. become twisted), causing acute one-sided testicular pain and may require surgical excision to achieve relief. 

One third of patients present with a palpable "blue dot" discoloration on the scrotum. 

This is nearly diagnostic of this condition. 

If clinical suspicion is high for the serious differential diagnosis of testicular torsion, a surgical exploration of the scrotum is warranted. 

Torsion of the appendix of testis occurs at ages 0–15 years, with a mean at 10 years, which is similar to that of testicular torsion.
