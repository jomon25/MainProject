SUPERIOR ARTICULAR PROCESS OF SACRUM


The superior articular processes project from it on either side; they are oval, concave, directed backward and medialward, like the superior articular processes of a lumbar vertebra.

They are attached to the body of the first sacral vertebra and to each ala, by short thick pedicles; on the upper surface of each pedicle is a vertebral notch, which forms the lower part of the foramen between the last lumbar and first sacral vertebrae.
