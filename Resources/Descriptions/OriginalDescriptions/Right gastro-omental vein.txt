RIGHT GASTRO-OMENTAL VEIN


The right gastro-omental vein is a blood vessel that drains blood from the greater curvature and left part of the body of the stomach into the superior mesenteric vein. 

It runs from left to right along the greater curvature of the stomach between the two layers of the greater omentum, along with the right gastroepiploic artery.

As a tributary of the superior mesenteric vein, it is a part of the hepatic portal system.
