POSTERIOR CALCANEAL ARTICULAR FACET


The posterior calcaneal articular surface is large and of an oval or oblong form. 

It articulates with the corresponding facet on the upper surface of the calcaneus, and is deeply concave in the direction of its long axis which runs forward and lateralward at an angle of about 45Â° with the median plane of the body.
