RIGHT PULMONARY ARTERY


The main pulmonary artery splits into the right and the left main pulmonary artery.

The right main pulmonary artery follows a longer and more horizontal course as it crosses the mediastinum. 

It passes underneath the aortic arch, behind the ascending aorta, and in front of the descending aorta. 

It courses posterior to the superior vena cava and in front of the right bronchus. 

Upon reaching the hilum of the right lung the right main pulmonary artery divides into two branches:

    -Truncus anterior — supplies blood to the right upper lobe
    -Interlobar artery — inferior and larger branch, supplies blood to the middle and inferior lobes of the lung.
