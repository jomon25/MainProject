JOINT(S)


A joint or articulation (or articular surface) is the connection made between bones in the body which link the skeletal system into a functional whole. 

They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. 

Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.

There are 360 joints in the adult human body.


=== Structural classification (binding tissue) ===

fibrous joint
cartilaginous joint

There are two types: primary cartilaginous joints composed of hyaline cartilage, and secondary cartilaginous joints composed of hyaline cartilage.

-Synovial joint

-Facet joint – joint between two articular processes between two vertebrae.


=== Functional classification (movement) ===

Joints can also be classified functionally according to the type and degree of movement they allow: 
    Joint movements are described with reference to the basic anatomical planes.
    
Synarthrosis – permits little or no mobility. 

    Most synarthrosis joints are fibrous joints (e.g., skull sutures).

-Amphiarthrosis – permits slight mobility. 

Most amphiarthrosis joints are cartilaginous joints (e.g., intervertebral discs).

Synovial joint (also known as a diarthrosis) – freely movable. 

Synovial joints can in turn be classified into six groups according to the type of movement they allow: 
    plane joint, ball and socket joint, hinge joint, pivot joint, condyloid joint and saddle joint.

Joints can also be classified, according to the number of axes of movement they allow, into nonaxial (gliding, as between the proximal ends of the ulna and radius), monoaxial (uniaxial), biaxial and multiaxial. 

Another classification is according to the degrees of freedom allowed, and distinguished between joints with one, two or three degrees of freedom. 

A further classification is according to the number and shapes of the articular surfaces: flat, concave and convex surfaces. 

Types of articular surfaces include trochlear surfaces.


=== Biomechanical classification ===

Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. 

According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into simple and compound, depending on the number of bones involved, and into complex and combination joints:

-Simple joint: 
    two articulation surfaces (e.g. shoulder joint, hip joint)

-Compound joint: 
    three or more articulation surfaces (e.g. radiocarpal joint)

-Complex joint: 
    two or more articulation surfaces and an articular disc or meniscus (e.g. knee joint)


=== Anatomical ===

The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:

-Joints of hand
-Elbow joints
-Wrist joints
-Axillary joints
-Sternoclavicular joints
-Vertebral articulations
-Temporomandibular joints
-Sacroiliac joints
-Hip joints
-Knee joints
-Articulations of foot

Unmyelinated nerve fibers are abundant in joint capsules and ligaments as well as in the outer part of intraarticular menisci. 

These nerve fibers are responsible for pain perception when a joint is strained.
