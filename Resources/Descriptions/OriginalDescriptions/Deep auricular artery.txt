DEEP AURICULAR ARTERY


The deep auricular artery often arises in common with the anterior tympanic artery.
It ascends in the substance of the parotid gland, behind the temporomandibular articulation, pierces the cartilaginous or bony wall of the external acoustic meatus, and supplies its cuticular lining and the outer surface of the tympanic membrane.
It gives a branch to the temporomandibular joint.
