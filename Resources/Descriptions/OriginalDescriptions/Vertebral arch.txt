VERTEBRAL ARCH


Every vertebra has a body (vertebral body), which consists of a large anterior middle portion called the centrum (vertebral centrum, plural centra) and a posterior vertebral arch, also called a neural arch.

The vertebral arch and processes have thicker coverings of cortical bone than the body of vertebra.
