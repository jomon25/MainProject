COMMON EXTENSOR TENDON


The common extensor tendon is a tendon that attaches to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.


== Structure ==

The common extensor tendon serves as the upper attachment (in part) for the superficial muscles that are located on the posterior aspect of the forearm:

-Extensor carpi radialis brevis
-Extensor carpi radialis longus
-Extensor digitorum
-Extensor digiti minimi
-Extensor carpi ulnaris

The tendon of extensor carpi radialis brevis is usually the most major tendon to which the other tendons merge.


== Function ==

The common extensor tendon is the major attachment point for extensor muscles of the forearm. 

This enables finger extension and aids in forearm supination.


== Clinical significance ==

Lateral elbow pain can be caused by various pathologies of the common extensor tendon. 

Overuse injuries can lead to inflammation. 

Tennis elbow is a common issue with the common extensor tendon.
