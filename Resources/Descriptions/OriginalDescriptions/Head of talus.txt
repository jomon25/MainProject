HEAD OF TALUS


The talus bone of the ankle joint connects the leg to the foot.

The head of talus looks forward and medialward; its anterior articular or navicular surface is large, oval, and convex. 

Its inferior surface has two facets, which are best seen in the fresh condition.

The medial, situated in front of the middle calcaneal facet, is convex, triangular, or semi-oval in shape, and rests on the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament; the lateral, named the anterior calcaneal articular surface, is somewhat flattened, and articulates with the facet on the upper surface of the anterior part of the calcaneus.
