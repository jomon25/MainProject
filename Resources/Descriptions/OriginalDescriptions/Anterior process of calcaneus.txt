ANTERIOR PROCESS OF CALCANEUS


On the front of the inferior surface of the calcaneus, the anterior process of calcaneus is the origin of the plantar calcaneocuboid ligament.

---

The anterior portion of the calcaneus is not explicitly described as a bony landmark in contemporary textbooks of human anatomy. 

However, it may be involved in all types of fractures of the largest tarsal bone. 

Both surgeons and radiologists are aware of the anterolateral extension of traumatic lesions of the calcaneus. 

Thus, the anterior portion of the bone should be referred to uniformly as the anterior process of calcaneus.
