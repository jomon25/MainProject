LINGUAL BRANCHES OF GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL NERVE


The lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve innervates the taste buds of the posterior 1/3 of the tongue and provides general sensation to this same area. 

The neuron cell bodies whose axons form the nerve, are found in the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve.
