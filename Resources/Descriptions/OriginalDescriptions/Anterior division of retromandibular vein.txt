ANTERIOR DIVISION OF RETROMANDIBULAR VEIN


The retromandibular vein emerges from the confluence of several veins, in front of the ear, and reaches the facial vein.


It is formed by the union of the superficial temporal vein and the maxillary vein. 

It descends in the substance of the parotid gland, superficial to the external carotid artery (but beneath the facial nerve), between the ramus of the mandible and the sternocleidomastoideus muscle.

It divides into two branches:

    the anterior division of retromandibular vein, which passes forward and joins anterior facial vein, to form the common facial vein, which then drains into the internal jugular vein.

    the posterior division of retromandibular vein, which is joined by the posterior auricular vein and becomes the external jugular vein.
