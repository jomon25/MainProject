POSTERIOR TUBERCLE OF ATLAS


The posterior arch forms about two-fifths of the circumference of the ring: 
    
    it ends behind in the posterior tubercle, which is the rudiment of a spinous process and gives origin to the Recti capitis posteriores minores and the ligamentum nuchae. 

The diminutive size of this process prevents any interference with the movements between the atlas and the skull.
