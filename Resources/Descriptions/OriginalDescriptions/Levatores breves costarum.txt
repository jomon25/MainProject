LEVATORES BREVES COSTARUM


Each of the four lower muscles of the twelve levatores costarum divides into two fasciculi, one of which pass obliquely downward and laterally, and is inserted into the outer surface of the rib immediately below the vertebra from which it takes origin, between the tubercle and the angle; it is called the levatores breves costarum.

The other passes down to the second rib below its origin  and is called the levatores costarum longi.
