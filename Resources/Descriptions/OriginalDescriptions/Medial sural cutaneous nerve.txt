MEDIAL SURAL CUTANEOUS NERVE


The medial sural cutaneous nerve is a sensory nerve of the leg. It supplies part of the medial side of the leg.


==Structure==

The medial sural cutaneous nerve originates from the posterior aspect of the tibial nerve of the sciatic nerve.

It descends between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle.

Around the middle of the back of the leg, it pierces the deep fascia to become superficial.

It unites with the lateral sural cutaneous nerve to form the sural nerve.
