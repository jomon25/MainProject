CUNEATE TUBERCLE


At the bottom of the medulla oblongata, can be seen four bumps: the pair of cuneate tubercles and the pair of gracile tubercles.

Both nuclei contain second-order neurons of the dorsal columnâ€“medial lemniscus pathway, which carries fine touch and proprioceptive information from the body to the brain. 

Fibres reach the thalamus.
