TUBEROSITY OF DISTAL PHALANX OF FOOT


The phalanx ends in an expanded distal extremity for the support of the nail and end of the toe; it is a crescent-shaped rough cap of bone epiphysis — the apical tuft (or ungual tuberosity/process) which covers a larger portion of the phalanx on the volar side than on the dorsal side. 

Two lateral ungual spines project proximally from the apical tuft. 

Near the base of the shaft are two lateral tubercles. 

Between these a V-shaped ridge extending proximally serves for the insertion of the flexor pollicis longus. 

Another ridge at the base serves for the insertion of the extensor aponeurosis.

The flexor insertion is sided by two fossae — the ungual fossa distally and the proximopalmar fossa proximally.
