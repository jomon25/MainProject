RED BONE MARROW


Red bone marrow is where red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells are created. 

Red blood cells carry oxygen to the lungs and organs. 

White blood cells are what strengthen our immune system and fight infections in the body. 

Because blood cells last anywhere from a few days up to four months depending on the type of blood cell, our body must create new blood cells all the time. 

Red bone marrow is what does that. 

Roughly 60 to 70 percent of white blood cells are produced in the red bone marrow, according to the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Society.

Red bone marrow can be found in the cavities of long bones, but is also found in the shoulder blades, hips, skull and flat bones.
