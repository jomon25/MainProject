APEX OF BLADDER


In gross anatomy, the bladder can be divided into a broad fundus, a body, an apex, and a neck.

The apex is directed forward toward the upper part of the pubic symphysis, and from there the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal wall to the umbilicus. 

The peritoneum is carried by it from the apex on to the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold.
