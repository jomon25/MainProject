PERFORATING VEINS


Reach the deep femoral vein

Perforator veins are so called because they perforate the deep fascia of muscles, to connect the superficial veins to the deep veins where they drain.

Perforator veins play an essential role in maintaining normal blood draining. 

They have valves which prevent blood flowing back (regurgitation) from deep to superficial veins in muscular systole or contraction.

They exist along the length of the lower limb, in greater number in the leg (anatomical ref to below knee) than in the thigh.
