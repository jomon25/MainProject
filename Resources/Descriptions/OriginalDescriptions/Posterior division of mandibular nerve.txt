POSTERIOR DIVISION OF MANDIBULAR NERVE


The mandibular nerve divides into a small anterior and large posterior trunk after passing between tensor veli palatini, which is medial, and lateral pterygoid, which is lateral, and giving off a meningeal branch (nervus spinosus) and the nerve to medial pterygoid from its medial side.

The posterior division gives off three main sensory branches, the auriculotemporal, lingual and inferior alveolar nerves and motor fibres to supply mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle:
    
-the auriculotemporal nerve
-the lingual nerve
-and the inferior alveolar nerve
