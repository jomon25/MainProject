ANTERIOR CILIARY ARTERIES


The anterior ciliary arteries are seven small arteries in each eye-socket that supply the conjunctiva, sclera and the recti muscles. 

They are derived from the muscular branches of the ophthalmic artery.

The anterior ciliary arteries are branches of the ophthalmic artery and run to the front of the eyeball in company with the extraocular muscles. 

They form a vascular zone beneath the conjunctiva, and then pierce the sclera a short distance from the cornea and end in the circulus arteriosus major.
Three of the four rectus muscles; the superior, inferior and medial, are supplied by two ciliary arteries each, while the lateral rectus only receives one branch.
