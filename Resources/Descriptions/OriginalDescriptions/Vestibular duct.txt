VESTIBULAR DUCT


The vestibular duct or scala vestibuli is a perilymph-filled cavity inside the cochlea of the inner ear that conducts sound vibrations to the cochlear duct.
It is separated from the cochlear duct by Reissner's membrane and extends from the vestibule of the ear to the helicotrema where it joins the tympanic duct.
