CALCANEAL TUBEROSITY


The half of the bone closest to the heel is the calcaneal tuberosity. 

On its lower edge on either side are its lateral and medial processes (serving as the origins of the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi). 

The calcaneal tendon is inserted into a roughened area on its inferior side.
