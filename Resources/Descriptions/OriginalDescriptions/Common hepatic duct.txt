COMMON HEPATIC DUCT


The common hepatic duct is the first part of the biliary tract. 

It joins the cystic duct coming from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct.


== Structure ==

The common hepatic duct is the first part of the biliary tract. 

It is formed by the convergence of the right hepatic duct (which drains bile from the right functional lobe of the liver) and the left hepatic duct (which drains bile from the left functional lobe of the liver). 

It then joins the cystic duct coming from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct.
The duct is usually 6â€“8 cm long. 

The common hepatic duct is about 6 mm in diameter in adults, with some variation. 

The inner surface is covered in a simple columnar epithelium.


=== Variation ===

Around 1.7% of people have additional accessory hepatic ducts that join onto the common hepatic duct.Rarely, the common hepatic duct joins onto the gallbladder directly, leading to illness.


== Function ==

The hepatic duct is part of the biliary tract that transports secretions from the liver into the intestines.


== Clinical significance ==



=== Cholecystectomy ===

The common hepatic ducts carries a higher volume of bile in people who have had their gallbladder removed.The common hepatic duct is an important anatomic landmark during surgeries such as cholecystectomy. 

It forms one edge of Calot's triangle, along with the cystic duct and the cystic artery. 

All constituents of this triangle must be identified to avoid cutting or clipping the wrong structure.


=== Cholestasis ===

A diameter of more than 8 mm is regarded as abnormal dilatation, and is a sign of cholestasis.


=== Mirizzi's syndrome ===

Mirizzi's syndrome occurs when the common hepatic duct is blocked by gallstones.
