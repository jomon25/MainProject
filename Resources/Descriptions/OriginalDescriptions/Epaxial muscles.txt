EPAXIAL MUSCLES


Some definitions oppose hypaxial and epaxial muscles as being ventral/dorsal to the vertebral septum.

The term 'Epaxial muscles of back' appeared in the second edition of the Terminologia Anatomica (TA2-2019) and does not correspond to this definition.

As no definition has been found, here is the list of hypaxial muscles:

-Suboccipital muscles
-Erector spinae
-Spinotransversales muscles
-Transversospinal muscles
-Interspinales muscles
-Intertransversarii muscles
