RECTOPROSTATIC FASCIA


The rectoprostatic fascia (Denonvilliers' fascia) is a membranous partition at the lowest part of the rectovesical pouch. 

It separates the prostate and urinary bladder from the rectum. 

It consists of a single fibromuscular structure with several layers that are fused together and covering the seminal vesicles. 

It is also called Denonvilliers' fascia after French anatomist and surgeon Charles-Pierre Denonvilliers.The structure corresponds to the rectovaginal fascia in the female. 

The rectoprostatic fascia also inhibits the posterior spread of prostatic adenocarcinoma; therefore invasion of the rectum is less common than is invasion of other contiguous structures.
