GREAT AURICULAR NERVE


The great auricular nerve is a cutaneous nerve of the head. 

It originates from the cervical plexus, with branches of spinal nerves C2 and C3. 

It provides sensory nerve supply to the skin over the parotid gland and the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and surfaces of the outer ear. 

Pain resulting from parotitis is caused by an impingement on the great auricular nerve.


== Structure ==

The great auricular nerve is the largest of the ascending branches of the cervical plexus. 

It arises from the second and third cervical nerves. 

It winds around the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and, after perforating the deep fascia, ascends upon that muscle beneath the platysma muscle to the parotid gland. 

Here, it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch.


=== Branches ===

The anterior branch (ramus anterior; facial branch) is distributed to the skin of the face over the parotid gland. 

It communicates with the facial nerve inside the parotid gland.
The posterior branch (ramus posterior; mastoid branch) supplies the skin over the mastoid process and on the back of the auricle, except at its upper part; a filament pierces the auricula to reach its lateral surface, where it is distributed to the lobule and lower part of the concha. 

The posterior branch communicates with the smaller occipital, the auricular branch of the vagus, and the posterior auricular branch of the facial.


== Function ==

The anterior branch of the great auricular nerve supplies the face over the parotid gland. 

The posterior branch of the great auricular nerve supplies the face over the mastoid process of the temporal bone, It also supplies parts of the auricle.


== Clinical significance ==

The great auricular nerve may be damaged during surgery on the parotid gland, reducing sensation to the face. 

Pain resulting from parotitis is caused by an impingement on the great auricular nerve.
