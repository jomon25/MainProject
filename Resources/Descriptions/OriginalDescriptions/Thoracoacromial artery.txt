THORACOACROMIAL ARTERY


The thoracoacromial artery (acromiothoracic artery; thoracic axis) is a short trunk that arises from the second part of the axillary artery, its origin being generally overlapped by the upper edge of the pectoralis minor.

Projecting forward to the upper border of the Pectoralis minor, it pierces the coracoclavicular fascia and divides into four branchesâ€”pectoral, acromial, clavicular, and deltoid.
