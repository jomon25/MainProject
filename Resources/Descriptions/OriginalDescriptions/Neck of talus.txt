NECK OF TALUS


The neck of talus is directed anteromedially, and comprises the constricted portion of the bone between the body and the oval head.

Its upper and medial surfaces are rough, for the attachment of ligaments; its lateral surface is concave and is continuous below with the deep groove for the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament.
