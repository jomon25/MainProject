GRACILE NUCLEUS


The gracile nucleus is medial to the cuneate nucleus.

Its neurons receive afferent input from dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons of the lower torso and the lower limbs.

The gracile nucleus and gracile fasciculus carry epicritic, kinesthetic, and conscious proprioceptive information from the lower part of the body (below the level of T6 in the spinal cord). 

Because of the large population of neurons in the gracile nucleus they give rise to a raised area called the gracile tubercle on the posterior side of the closed medulla at the floor of the fourth ventricle.
