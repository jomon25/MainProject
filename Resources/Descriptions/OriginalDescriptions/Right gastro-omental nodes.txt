RIGHT GASTRO-OMENTAL NODES


The right and left gastro-omental nodes are located on the great curvature of stomach on the path of the left/right gastro-omental arteries.

They drain the stomach and the greater omentum, on the right towards the hepatic nodes, and on the left to the splenic nodes and pancreatic nodes.
