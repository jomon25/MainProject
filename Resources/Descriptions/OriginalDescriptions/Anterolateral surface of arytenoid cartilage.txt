ANTEROLATERAL SURFACE OF ARYTENOID CARTILAGE


The antero-lateral surface is somewhat convex and rough. 

On it, near the apex of the cartilage, is a rounded elevation (colliculus) from which a ridge (crista arcuata) curves at first backward and then downward and forward to the vocal process. 

The lower part of this crest intervenes between two depressions or fove√¶, an upper, triangular, and a lower oblong in shape; the latter gives attachment to the thyroarytenoid muscle (vocal muscle).
