SUPERIOR PUBIC LIGAMENT


The superior pubic ligament and the inferior pubic ligament provide stability to the pubic symphysis; the anterior and posterior ligaments are weaker. 

The strong and thicker superior ligament is reinforced by the tendons of the rectus abdominis muscle, the abdominal external oblique muscle, the gracilis muscle, and by muscles of the hip.

The superior pubic ligament connects together the two pubic bones superiorly, extending laterally as far as the pubic tubercles. 

Above, it is blended with the interpubic fibrocartilaginous lamina; laterally, it is attached to the inferior rami of the pubic bones; below, it is free, and is separated from the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm by an opening through which the deep dorsal vein of the penis passes into the pelvis.
