POSTERIOR PROCESS OF TALUS


On the posterior surface of the talus, the posterior process of talus is located lateral to the groove for tendon of flexor hallucis longus of talus.

It is a prominent tubercle to which the posterior talofibular ligament is attached; this process is sometimes separated from the rest of the talus, and is then known as the os trigonum. 

N.B.:Medial to the groove is a second smaller tubercle.
