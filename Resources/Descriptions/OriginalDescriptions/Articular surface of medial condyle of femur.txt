ARTICULAR SURFACE OF MEDIAL CONDYLE OF FEMUR




MEDIAL CONDYLE OF FEMUR


The medial condyle is one of the two projections on the lower extremity of femur, the other being the lateral condyle.

The medial condyle is larger than the lateral (outer) condyle due to more weight bearing caused by the centre of mass being medial to the knee.
