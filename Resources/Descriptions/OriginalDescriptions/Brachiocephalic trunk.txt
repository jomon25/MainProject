BRACHIOCEPHALIC TRUNK


The brachiocephalic arterial trunk is an artery that arises from the aorta, it is located in the superior mediastinum and carries oxygenated blood to the right upper limb, the head and the neck.

It forms, with the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery, all of the supra-aortic trunks,

This is the first large-caliber collateral of the aorta (the first collaterals of the aorta being the coronary arteries).

This artery, shortly after its origin, divides into two collateral arteries:
    
    -the right common carotid artery
    -and the right subclavian artery.

It has no counterpart on the left where it is replaced by the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery, which start directly and independently from the roof of the aorta.

In addition, there are two brachiocephalic veins, one right and one left.

It arises from the horizontal portion of the aorta just after the first curvature, it measures 2.8 to 3 cm and is located in front and to the right of the two other collaterals of the aorta.

This trunk rises upwards and to the right, passes in front of the trachea where it divides.

The right subclavian artery is abandoned by the brachiocephalic arterial trunk above the first rib, it is directed upwards and outwards to bring oxygenated blood to the right upper limb.

It is continued by the axillary artery and gives various collaterals.

The right common carotid is more medial than the previous one, it runs vertically upwards to supply the head and neck.

It will divide into the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery.
