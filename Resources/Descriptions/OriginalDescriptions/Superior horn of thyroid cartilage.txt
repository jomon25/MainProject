SUPERIOR HORN OF THYROID CARTILAGE


The most posterior part of the cartilage also has two projections upwards and downwards. 

The upper projection is called the superior horn (cornu), and the lower is called the inferior horn. 

The superior horn is long and narrow, backward, and medialward, and ends in a conical extremity, which gives attachment to the lateral thyrohyoid ligament.
