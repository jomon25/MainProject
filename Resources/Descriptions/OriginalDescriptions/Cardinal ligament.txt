CARDINAL LIGAMENT


The cardinal ligament (or Mackenrodt's ligament, lateral cervical ligament, or transverse cervical ligament) is a major ligament of the uterus. 

It is located at the base of the broad ligament of the uterus. 

There are a pair of cardinal ligaments in the female human body.


== Structure ==

The cardinal ligament is a paired structure on the lateral side of the uterus. 

It originates from the lateral part of the cervix. 

It attaches to the uterosacral ligament.It attaches the cervix to the lateral pelvic wall by its attachment to the Obturator fascia of the Obturator internus muscle, and is continuous externally with the fibrous tissue that surrounds the pelvic blood vessels. 

It thus provides support to the uterus.It carries the uterine arteries to provide the primary blood supply to the uterus.


== Clinical significance ==

The cardinal ligament may be affected in hysterectomy. 

Due to its close proximity to the ureters, it can get damaged during ligation of the ligament. 

It is routinely cut during some uterine operations, although this can have side effects.
