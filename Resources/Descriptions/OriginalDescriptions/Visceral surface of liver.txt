VISCERAL SURFACE OF LIVER


The visceral surface or inferior surface is uneven and concave. 

It is covered in peritoneum apart from where it attaches the gallbladder and the porta hepatis.

The fossa of gall bladder lies to the right of the quadrate lobe, occupied by the gallbladder with its cystic duct close to the right end of porta hepatis.
