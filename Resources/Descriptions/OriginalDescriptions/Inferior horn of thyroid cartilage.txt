INFERIOR HORN OF THYROID CARTILAGE


The most posterior part of the cartilage also has two projections upwards and downwards. 

The lower projection is called the inferior horn (cornu), and the upper is called the superior horn.

The inferior horn is short and thick; it is directed downward, with a slight inclination forward and medialward, and presents, on the medial side of its tip, a small oval articular facet for articulation with the side of the cricoid cartilage.
