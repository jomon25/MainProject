PISOHAMATE LIGAMENT


The pisohamate ligament is a ligament in the hand. 

It connects the pisiform to the hook of the hamate. 

It is a prolongation of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris.
It serves as part of the origin for the abductor digiti minimi. 

It also forms the floor of the ulnar canal, a canal that allows the ulnar nerve and ulnar artery into the hand.
