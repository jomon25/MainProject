ANTERIOR INTERCAVERNOUS SINUS


The intercavernous sinuses are two in number, an anterior and a posterior, and connect the two cavernous sinuses[1] across the middle line.


Intercavernous sinuses

The anterior passes in front of the hypophysis cerebri (pituitary gland), the posterior behind it, and they form with the cavernous sinuses a venous circle (circular sinus) around the hypophysis.

The anterior one is usually the larger of the two, and one or other is occasionally absent.
