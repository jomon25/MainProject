SUPRAORBITAL ARTERY


The supraorbital artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery in the orbit. 

It travels with the supraorbital nerve to provide blood to the forehead.


== Structure ==

The supraorbital artery branches from the ophthalmic artery after it passes through the optic canal and passes medially over the optic nerve. 

It travels anteriorly in the orbit by passing superior to the eye and medial to the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris. 

It then travels with the supraorbital nerve between the periosteum of the roof of the orbit and the levator palpebrae superioris to enter the supraorbital foramen. 

After passing through the supraorbital foramen, it bifurcates into a superficial and deep branch. 

Its terminal branches anastomose with the supratrochlear artery and frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery.


== Function ==

This artery supplies the levator palpebrae superioris, the diploÃ« of the frontal bone, the frontal sinus, the upper eyelid, and the skin of the forehead and the scalp.
This artery may be absent in 10% to 20% of individuals.
