MESO-APPENDIX


The mesentery becomes attached to the colon at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several regions of the mesocolon. 

The parts of the mesocolon take their names from the part of the colon to which they attach. 

These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.
