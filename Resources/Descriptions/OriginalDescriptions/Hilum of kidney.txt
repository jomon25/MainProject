HILUM OF KIDNEY


The renal hilum (Latin: hilum renale) or renal pedicle is the hilum of the kidney, that is, its recessed central fissure where its vessels, nerves and ureter pass. 

The medial border of the kidney is concave in the center and convex toward either extremity; it is directed forward and a little downward. 

Its central part presents a deep longitudinal fissure, bounded by prominent overhanging anterior and posterior lips. 

This fissure is a hilum that transmits the vessels, nerves, and ureter. 

From anterior to posterior, the renal vein exits, the renal artery enters, and the renal pelvis exits the kidney.

On the left hand side the hilum is located at the L1 vertebral level and the right kidney at level L1-2. 

The lower border of the kidneys is usually alongside L3. 

==Hilum's Order==

The superior, middle, and inferior vessels enter or leave the hilum of kidney: from anterior to posterior is renal vein, renal artery and renal pelvis, respectively.
