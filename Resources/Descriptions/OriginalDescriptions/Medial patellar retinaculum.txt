MEDIAL PATELLAR RETINACULUM


The medial patellar retinaculum is the branch of the tendon of insertion of the quadriceps femoris that crosses the knee on the medial side of the patella. 

Most of the fibers of the medial patellar retinaculum originate in the medial femoral region from the vastus medialis muscle, just superior to the patella.
