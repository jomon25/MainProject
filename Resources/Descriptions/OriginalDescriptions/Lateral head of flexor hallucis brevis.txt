LATERAL HEAD OF FLEXOR HALLUCIS BREVIS


The flexor hallucis brevis divides in front into two portions, which are inserted into the medial and lateral sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, a sesamoid bone being present in each tendon at its insertion. 

The medial head of flexor hallucis brevis is blended with the abductor hallucis muscle previous to its insertion; the lateral head of flexor hallucis brevis (sometimes described as the first plantar interosseus) with the adductor hallucis muscle.
