ANTERIOR TUBERCLE OF TRANSVERSE PROCESS


Each transverse process of the cervical vertebrae consists of an anterior and a posterior part.

These two parts are joined, outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.

    The anterior portion is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the costal process or costal element. 
    
    It arises from the side of the body, is directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior tubercle.
