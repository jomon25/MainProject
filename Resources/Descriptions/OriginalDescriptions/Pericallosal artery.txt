PERICALLOSAL ARTERY


A3, also termed the pericallosal artery, is one of the (or the only) main terminal branches of the ACA, which extends posteriorly in the pericallosal sulcus to form the internal parietal arteries (superior, inferior) and the precuneal artery. 

This artery may form an anastomosis with the posterior cerebral artery.
