SPONGY BONE


Cancellous bone, also called trabecular or spongy bone, is the internal tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell porous network. 

Cancellous bone has a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than cortical bone and it is less dense. 

This makes it weaker and more flexible. 

The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. 

Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near joints and in the interior of vertebrae. 

Cancellous bone is highly vascular and often contains red bone marrow where hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells, occurs. 

The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the trabecula. 

The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the femur. 

As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the vertebral pedicle.

Thin formations of osteoblasts covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces, known as trabeculae. 

Within these spaces are bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells.

Trabecular marrow is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow. 

Trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone.

The words cancellous and trabecular refer to the tiny lattice-shaped units (trabeculae) that form the tissue. 

It was first illustrated accurately in the engravings of Cris√≥stomo Martinez.
