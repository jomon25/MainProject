ALA OF NOSE


The ala of the nose (ala nasi, "wing of the nose"; plural alae) is the lower lateral surface of the external nose, shaped by the alar cartilage and covered in dense connective tissue.

The alae flare out to form a rounded eminence around the nostril.

Sexual dimorphism is evident in the larger nose of the male. 

This is due to the increased testosterone that thickens the brow ridge and the bridge of the nose making it wider.
