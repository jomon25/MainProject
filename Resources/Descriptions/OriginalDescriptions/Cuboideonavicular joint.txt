CUBOIDEONAVICULAR JOINT


The cuboideonavicular joint is a joint (articulation) in the foot formed between the navicular bone and cuboid bone.
The navicular bone is connected with the cuboid bone by the dorsal, plantar, and interosseous cuboideonavicular ligaments.


== The dorsal ligaments ==

The dorsal cuboideonavicular ligament are three small bundles, one attached to each of the cuneiform bones.
The bundle connecting the navicular bone with the medial cuneiform is continuous around the medial side of the articulation with the plantar ligament which unites these two bones.


== The plantar ligaments ==

The plantar cuboideonavicular ligaments have a similar arrangement to the dorsal, and are strengthened by slips from the tendon of the tibialis posterior.


== Synovial membrane ==

The synovial membrane of this joints is part of the great tarsal synovial membrane.


== Movements ==

Mere gliding movements are permitted between the navicular and cuneiform bones.
