LATERAL MASS


The lateral masses are the most bulky and solid parts of the atlas, in order to support the weight of the head.

Each carries two articular facets, a superior and an inferior.

    The superior facets are of large size, oval, concave, and approach each other in front, but diverge behind: 
        
        they are directed upward, medially, and a little backward, each forming a cup for the corresponding condyle of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. 
    
    Not infrequently they are partially subdivided by indentations which encroach upon their margins.
    
    The inferior articular facets are circular in form, flattened or slightly convex and directed downward and medially, articulating with the axis, and permitting the rotatory movements of the head.
