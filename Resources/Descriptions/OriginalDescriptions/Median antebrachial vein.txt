MEDIAN ANTEBRACHIAL VEIN


The median antebrachial vein drains the venous plexus on the palmar surface of the hand.

It travels up on the ulnar side of the front of the forearm and ends in the basilic vein or in the vena mediana cubiti; in a small proportion of cases it divides into two branches, one of which joins the basilic, the other the cephalic, below the elbow.
