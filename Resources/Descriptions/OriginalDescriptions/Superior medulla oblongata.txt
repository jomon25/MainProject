SUPERIOR MEDULLA OBLONGATA


The medulla can be thought of as being in two parts:

    -an upper open part or superior part where the dorsal surface of the medulla is formed by the fourth ventricle.
    
    -a lower closed part or inferior part where the fourth ventricle has narrowed at the obex in the caudal medulla, and surrounds part of the central canal.
