(ARTICULAR DISC OF ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT)


Intermediate plate in fibrocartilage.

It is in contact with the superior acromioclavicular ligament, and sometimes with the inferior acromioclavicular ligament.

==Variation==

This meniscus may be a blade of fibrocartilage that extends nearly halfway into the joint or it may form a complete disc that divides the joint into two parts.
