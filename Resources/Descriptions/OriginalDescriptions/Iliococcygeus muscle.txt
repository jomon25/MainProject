ILIOCOCCYGEUS MUSCLE


The levator ani is made up of 3 parts:

    -Iliococcygeus muscle
    -Pubococcygeus muscle
    -Puborectalis muscle

The iliococcygeus arises from the inner side of the ischium (the lower and back part of the hip bone) and from the posterior part of the tendinous arch of the obturator fascia, and is attached to the coccyx and anococcygeal body; it is usually thin, and may be absent, or be largely replaced by fibrous tissue. 

An accessory slip at its posterior part is sometimes named the iliosacralis.
