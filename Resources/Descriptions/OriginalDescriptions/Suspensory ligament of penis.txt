SUSPENSORY LIGAMENT OF PENIS


The suspensory ligament of the penis is attached to the pubic symphysis, which holds the penis close to the pubic bone and supports it when erect. 

The ligament does not directly connect to the Corpus cavernosum penis, but may still play a role in erectile dysfunction. 

The ligament can be surgically lengthened in a procedure known as ligamentolysis, which is a form of penis enlargement.
