PROMONTORY


On the base of sacrum, the sacral promontory marks part of the border of the pelvic inlet, and comprises the iliopectineal line and the linea terminalis.

The sacral promontory articulates with the last lumbar vertebra to form the sacrovertebral angle, an angle of 30 degrees from the horizontal plane that provides a useful marker for a sling implant procedure.
