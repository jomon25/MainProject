ILEOCECAL FOLD


The ileocecal fold or ileocaecal fold is an anatomical structure in the human abdomen, located between the ileum and the cecum. 

It is formed by a layer of peritoneum. 

The upper border is fixed to the ileum, opposite its mesenteric attachment, while the lower border passes over the ileocecal junction to join the mesentery of the vermiform process, and sometimes the process itself. 

Behind the fold is the inferior ileocecal fossa. 

The structure is also called the ligament, veil, or bloodless fold of Treves after English surgeon Sir Frederick Treves.
Although, the ileocecal fold is termed as the bloodless fold of Treves, it often contains a vessel.
