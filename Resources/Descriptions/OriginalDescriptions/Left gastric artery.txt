LEFT GASTRIC ARTERY


In human anatomy, the left gastric artery arises from the celiac artery and runs along the superior portion of the lesser curvature of the stomach. 

Branches also supply the lower esophagus. 

The left gastric artery anastomoses with the right gastric artery, which runs right to left.


== Clinical significance ==

In terms of disease, the left gastric artery may be involved in peptic ulcer disease: if an ulcer erodes through the stomach mucosa into a branch of the artery, this can cause massive blood loss into the stomach, which may result in such symptoms as hematemesis or melaena.
