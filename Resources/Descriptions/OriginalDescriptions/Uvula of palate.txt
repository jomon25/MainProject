UVULA OF PALATE


The palatine uvula, usually referred to as simply the uvula, is a conic projection from the back edge of the middle of the soft palate, composed of connective tissue containing a number of racemose glands, and some muscular fibers.

It also contains many serous glands, which produce thin saliva.

Structure
Muscle

The muscular part of the uvula (Latin: musculus uvulae) shortens and broadens the uvula. 

This changes the contour of the posterior part of the soft palate. 

This change in contour allows the soft palate to adapt closely to the posterior pharyngeal wall to help close the nasopharynx during swallowing.

Its muscles are controlled by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve.


==Function==

During swallowing, the soft palate and the uvula move together to close off the nasopharynx, and prevent food from entering the nasal cavity.

It has also been proposed that the abundant amount of thin saliva produced by the uvula serves to keep the throat well lubricated.

It has a function in speech as well. 

In many languages, the uvula is used to articulate a range of consonant sounds, known as uvular consonants. 

The voiced uvular trill, written [Ê€] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is one example; it is used in French, Arabic and Hebrew, among other languages. 

Due to the large amount of saliva produced from glands in the uvula that are absent in other mammals, it has been suggested that the uvula is an accessory speech organ.

Stimulation of the uvula also causes the gag reflex to initiate. 

This is often a problem for people with uvula piercings, and a common method of inducing vomiting.
