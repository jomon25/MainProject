INFERIOR MEDULLA OBLONGATA


The medulla can be thought of as being in two parts:

    An upper open part or superior medulla oblongata where the dorsal surface of the medulla is formed by the fourth ventricle.
    
    A lower closed part or inferior medulla oblongata where the fourth ventricle has narrowed at the obex in the caudal medulla, and surrounds part of the central canal.
