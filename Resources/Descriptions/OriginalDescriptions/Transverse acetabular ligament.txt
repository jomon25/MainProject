TRANSVERSE ACETABULAR LIGAMENT


The transverse acetabular ligament (transverse ligament) is a portion of the acetabular labrum, though differing from it in having no cartilage cells among its fibers.
It consists of strong, flattened fibers, which cross the acetabular notch, and convert it into a foramen through which the nutrient vessels enter the joint. 

It is an intra-articular structure of the hip.
