GREY MATTER OF SPINAL CORD


Grey matter in the spinal cord is known as the grey column which travels down the spinal cord distributed in three grey columns that are presented in an "H" shape. 

The forward-facing column is the anterior grey column, the rear-facing one is the posterior grey column and the interlinking one is the lateral grey column. 

The grey matter on the left and right side is connected by the grey commissure. 

The grey matter in the spinal cord consists of interneurons, as well as the cell bodies of projection neurons.
