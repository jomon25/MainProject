DEEP ARTERY OF PENIS


The deep artery of the penis (artery to the corpus cavernosum), one of the terminal branches of the internal pudendal, arises from that vessel while it is situated between the two fasci√¶ of the urogenital diaphragm (deep perineal pouch).

It pierces the inferior fascia, and, entering the crus penis obliquely, runs forward in the center of the corpus cavernosum penis, to which its branches are distributed.
