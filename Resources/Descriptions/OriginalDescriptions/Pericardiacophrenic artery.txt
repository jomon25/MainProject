PERICARDIACOPHRENIC ARTERY


The pericardiacophrenic artery is a long slender branch of the internal thoracic artery. 

It anastomoses with the musculophrenic and superior phrenic arteries.


== Location ==

The pericardiacophrenic artery branches from the internal thoracic artery. 

It accompanies the phrenic nerve between the pleura and pericardium, to the diaphragm. 

This is where both the artery and the phrenic nerve are distributed.


== Function ==

The pericardiacophrenic arteries travel through the thoracic cavity, and are located within and supply the fibrous pericardium. 

Along with the musculophrenic arteries, they also provide arterial supply to the diaphragm.
