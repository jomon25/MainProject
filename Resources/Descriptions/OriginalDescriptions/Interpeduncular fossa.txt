INTERPEDUNCULAR FOSSA


The interpeduncular fossa is a somewhat rhomboid-shaped area of the base of the brain, limited in front by the optic chiasma, behind by the antero-superior surface of the pons, antero-laterally by the converging optic tracts, and postero-laterally by the diverging cerebral peduncles.

The floor of interpeduncular fossa, from behind forward, are the posterior perforated substance, corpora mamillaria, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and pituitary gland.

Contents of interpeduncular fossa include oculomotor nerve, and circle of Willis.


== Anatomy ==

The interpeduncular fossa is located in the posterior portion of the brain, in the brain stem.

It has been found in humans and macaques, but not in rats or mice, showing that this is a relatively new evolutionary region.


== Clinical significance ==

The most common locations for neurocutaneous melanosis have occurred along the interpeduncular fossa, ventral brainstem, upper cervical cord, and ventral lumbosacral cord.
