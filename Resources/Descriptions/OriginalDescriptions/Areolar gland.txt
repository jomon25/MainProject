AREOLAR GLAND


Areolar glands, or Glands of Montgomery, are sebaceous glands in the areola surrounding the nipple. 

They produce an oily secretion to lubricate the nipple. 


== Structure ==

Areolar glands are round bumps found in the areola, and sometimes on the nipple.


=== Variation ===

The tubercles become more pronounced during pregnancy. 

The number of glands can vary greatly, usually averaging from 4 to 28 per breast.


== Function ==

Areolar glands make oily secretions (lipoid fluid) to keep the areola and the nipple lubricated and protected. 

Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for newborn appetite. 

They can become exposed and raised when the nipple is stimulated. 

The skin over the surface opening is lubricated and tends to be smoother than the rest of the areola.


== Clinical significance ==

Areolar glands may secrete excessive amounts of oil. 

This is a neutral condition that rarely represents any underlying problem, unlike galactorrhoea.


== History ==

Areolar glands may also be called Glands of Montgomery, or Montgomery tubercles. 

They are named after Dr. 

William Fetherstone Montgomery (1797â€“1859), an Irish obstetrician who first described them in 1837.
