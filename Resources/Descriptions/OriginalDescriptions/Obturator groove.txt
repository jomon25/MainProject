OBTURATOR GROOVE


The thin and uneven margin of the obturator formaen -to which a strong membrane is attached- presents, superiorly, a deep groove, the obturator groove, which runs from the pelvis obliquely medialward and downward.

This groove is converted into the obturator canal by a ligamentous band, a specialized part of the obturator membrane, attached to two tubercles:

    -one, the posterior obturator tubercle, on the medial border of the ischium, just in front of the acetabular notch

    -the other, the anterior obturator tubercle, on the obturator crest of the superior ramus of the pubis.
