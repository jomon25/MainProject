ACROMIAL END/
LATERAL END


The acromial end is flat from above downward. 

It bears a facet that articulates with the shoulder to form the acromioclavicular joint. 

The area surrounding the joint gives an attachment to the joint capsule. 

The anterior border is concave forward and the posterior border is convex backward.
