SESAMOID BONES OF FOOT


In the footâ€”the first metatarsal bone usually has two sesamoid bones at its connection to the big toe (both within the tendon of flexor hallucis brevis).

One is found on the lateral side of the first metatarsal while the other is found on the medial side. 

In some people, only a single sesamoid is found on the first metatarsal bone.
