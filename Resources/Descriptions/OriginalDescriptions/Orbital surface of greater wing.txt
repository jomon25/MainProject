ORBITAL SURFACE OF GREATER WING


The orbital surface of the great wing, smooth, and quadrilateral in shape, is directed forward and medially and forms the posterior part of the lateral wall of the orbit.

Its upper serrated edge articulates with the orbital plate of the frontal bone.
    
Its inferior rounded border forms the postero-lateral boundary of the inferior orbital fissure.
    
Its medial sharp margin forms the lower boundary of the superior orbital fissure and has projecting from about its center a little tubercle that gives attachment to the inferior head of the lateral rectus muscle; at the upper part of this margin is a notch for the transmission of a recurrent branch of the lacrimal artery.
    
Its lateral margin is serrated and articulates with the zygomatic bone.
    
Below the medial end of the superior orbital fissure is a grooved surface, which forms the posterior wall of the pterygopalatine fossa, and is pierced by the foramen rotundum.
