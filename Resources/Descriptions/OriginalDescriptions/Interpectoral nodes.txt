INTERPECTORAL NODES


The small interpectoral lymph nodes are located between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles. 

They receive lymphatic fluid from the muscles and the mammary gland, and deliver lymphatic fluid to the axillary lymphatic plexus. 

These lymph nodes are susceptible to breast cancer, as the cancer sometimes spreads (metastasizes) to the interpectoral lymph nodes. 

It signifies retrograde spread of tumour.
