(ADDUCTOR MINIMUS)


Small and flat skeletal muscle in the thigh which constitutes the upper, lateral part of the adductor magnus muscle. 

It adducts and laterally rotates the femur.

The adductor minimus originates on the pelvis at the inferior ramus of the pubis as the anterior-most part of the adductor magnus. 

It is inserted on the back of the femur at the medial lip of the linea aspera and thus crosses the proximal part of the true adductor magnus.


=== Innervation ===

    -obturator nerve
    -tibial nerve (L3-5), 
    -a branch of the sciatic nerve
