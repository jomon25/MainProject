OBLIQUE FISSURE OF RIGHT LUNG


The fissures are formed in early prenatal development by invaginations of the visceral pleura that divide the lobar bronchi, and section the lungs into lobes that helps in their expansion.

The right lung is divided into three lobes by a horizontal fissure, and an oblique fissure. 

The oblique fissure separates the middle lobe of right lung and the inferior lobe of right lung.
