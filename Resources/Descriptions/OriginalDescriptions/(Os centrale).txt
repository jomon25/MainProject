(OS CENTRALE)


The os carpi centrale (also briefly os centrale) is, where present, located on the dorsal side of the wrist between the scaphoid, the trapezoid and capitate, radially to the deep fossa of the capitate. 

The bone is present in almost every human embryo of 17â€“49 mm length, but then usually fuses with the ulnar side of the scaphoid. 

Sometimes it fuses with the capitate or the trapezoid. 

The literature also refers to an os centrale at the palm of the carpus, but this existence is questioned.

In most primates, including orangutans and gibbons, the os centrale is an independent bone that is attached to the scaphoid by strong ligaments.
