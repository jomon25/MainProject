DEEP INGUINAL NODES


There can be three, four or five deep inguinal lymph nodes. 

They lie medial to the femoral vein under the cribriform fascia. 

The uppermost node is in the groin, under the inguinal ligament, and is called Cloquet's node (also Rosenmuller's node).

This node is named for French surgeon Jules Germain Cloquet, or for German anatomist Johann Christian Rosenm√ºller. 

It can also be considered as the lowest of the external iliac lymph nodes.

Cloquet's node is also considered as a potential sentinel lymph node.

The deep inguinal lymph nodes drain superiorly to the external iliac lymph nodes, then to the pelvic lymph nodes and on to the paraaortic lymph nodes.
