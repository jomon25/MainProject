HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE


The hypothenar muscles are a group of three muscles of the palm that control the motion of the little finger.

The three muscles are:
Abductor digiti minimi
Flexor digiti minimi brevis
Opponens digiti minimi


== Structure ==

The muscles of hypothenar eminence are from medial to lateral:

Opponens digiti minimi
Flexor digiti minimi brevis
Abductor digiti minimiThe intrinsic muscles of hand can be remembered using the mnemonic, "A OF A OF A" for, Abductor pollicis brevis, Opponens pollicis, Flexor pollicis brevis (the three thenar muscles), Adductor pollicis, and the three hypothenar muscles, Opponens digiti minimi, Flexor digiti minimi brevis, Abductor digiti minimi.


== Clinical significance ==

"Hypothenar atrophy" is associated with the lesion of the ulnar nerve, which supplies the three hypothenar muscles.
Hypothenar hammer syndrome is a vascular occlusion of this region.
