INTERNAL SPERMATIC FASCIA


The internal spermatic fascia (infundibuliform fascia, or Le deuxi√®me fascia de Webster) is a thin layer, which loosely invests the spermatic cord.


== Structure ==

The internal spermatic fascia is derived from the transversalis fascia. 

It is acquired by the spermatic cord at the deep inguinal ring. 

It has very little lymphatic drainage. 

It is mainly supplied by sensory afferents and the sympathetic nervous system.
