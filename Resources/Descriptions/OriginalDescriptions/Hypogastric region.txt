HYPOGASTRIC REGION


The hypogastrium (also called the hypogastric region or suprapubic region) is a region of the abdomen located below the umbilical region. 

The pubis bone constitutes its lower limit. 

The roots of the word hypogastrium mean "below the stomach"; the roots of suprapubic mean "above the pubic bone".
