UTERINE ARTERY


The uterine artery is an artery that supplies blood to the uterus in females.


== Structure ==

The uterine artery usually arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. 

It travels to the uterus, crossing the ureter anteriorly, to the uterus by traveling in the cardinal ligament.

It travels through the parametrium of the inferior broad ligament of the uterus.
It commonly anastomoses (connects with) the ovarian artery.
The uterine artery is the major blood supply to the uterus and enlarges significantly during pregnancy.


=== Branches and organs supplied ===

round ligament of the uterus
ovary ("ovarian branches")
uterus (arcuate vessels)
vagina (Vaginal branches of uterine artery)
uterine tube ("tubal branch")


=== Anatomical variants ===

Uterine artery can arise from the first branch of inferior gluteal artery. 

It can can also arise as the 2nd or 3rd branch from the inferior gluteal artery. 

On the other hand, uterine artery can be first branch from internal iliac artery before the superior and inferior gluteal arteries branching off from the main arterial trunk. 

In addition to that, uterine artery can also arise directly from internal iliac artery together with superior and inferior gluteal arteries.


== Clinical significance ==



=== Hysterectomy ===

The uterine arteries are ligated during hysterectomy.
