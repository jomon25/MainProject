LINGULA OF LEFT LUNG


The left lung, unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does have a homologous feature, a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula. 

Its name means "little tongue". 

The lingula on the left lung serves as an anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications.

There are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula: superior and inferior.
