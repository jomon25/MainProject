INTERSPINALES LUMBORUM MUSCLES


In the lumbar region there are four pairs of lumbar interspinales (Interspinales lumborum muscles) in the intervals between the five lumbar vertebrae. 

There is also occasionally one between the last thoracic and first lumbar, and one between the fifth lumbar and the sacrum.
