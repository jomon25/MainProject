CAROTICOTYMPANIC ARTERIES


The caroticotympanic arteries (tympanic branch) are small branches of the internal carotid artery; they enter the tympanic cavity through a minute foramen in the carotid canal, and anastomose with the anterior tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and with the posterior tympanic branch of the stylomastoid artery.
