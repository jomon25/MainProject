ANTERIOR TALOFIBULAR LIGAMENT


The anterior talofibular ligament is a ligament in the ankle.
It passes from the anterior margin of the fibular malleolus, anteriorly and laterally, to the talus bone, in front of its lateral articular facet. 

It is one of the lateral ligaments of the ankle and prevents the foot from sliding forward in relation to the shin. 

It is the most commonly injured ligament in a sprained ankle—from an inversion injury—and will allow a positive anterior drawer test of the ankle if completely torn.
