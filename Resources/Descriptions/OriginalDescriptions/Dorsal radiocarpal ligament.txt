DORSAL RADIOCARPAL LIGAMENT


The dorsal radiocarpal ligament (posterior ligament) is less thick and strong than its volar (anterior) counterpart, and has a proximal attachment to the posterior border of the distal radius. 

Its fibers run medially and inferiorly to form a distal attachment at the dorsal surfaces of the scaphoid (navicular bone of the hand), lunate, and triquetral.

The fibres of the dorsal radiocarpal ligament blend with those of the dorsal intercarpal ligament.

It is in relation, behind, with the Extensor tendons of the fingers; in front, it is blended with the articular disk.
