SPINALIS CAPITIS MUSCLE


Spinalis capitis (biventer cervicis) is usually inseparably connected with the semispinalis capitis.

Spinalis capitis is not well characterized in modern anatomy textbooks and atlases, and is often omitted from anatomical illustration. 

However, it can be identified as fibers that extend from the spinous processes of TV1 and CV7 to the cranium, often blending with semispinalis capitis.
