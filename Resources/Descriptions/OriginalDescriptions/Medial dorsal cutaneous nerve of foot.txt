MEDIAL DORSAL CUTANEOUS NERVE OF FOOT


The medial dorsal cutaneous nerve of foot passes in front of the ankle-joint, and divides into two dorsal digital branches, one of which supplies the medial side of the great toe, the other, the adjacent side of the second and third toes.

It also supplies the integument of the medial side of the foot and ankle, and communicates with the saphenous nerve, and with the deep peroneal nerve.
