CUNEATE NUCLEUS


The cuneate nucleus is lateral to the gracile nucleus.

It carries the same type of information, but from the upper body and the upper limbs (except the face, which is carried by the principal sensory nucleus of trigeminal nerve).

The cuneate nucleus is wedge-shaped and located in the closed part of the medulla. 

It lies lateral to the gracile nucleus and medial to the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the medulla. 

The large number of neurons found there give rise to the cuneate tubercle seen on viewing the posterior aspect of the medulla on the side of the brainstem.
