INFERIOR GLUTEAL VEINS


The inferior gluteal veins (sciatic veins), or venae comitantes of the inferior gluteal artery, begin on the upper part of the back of the thigh, where they anastomose with the medial femoral circumflex and first perforating veins.
They enter the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen and join to form a single stem which opens into the lower part of the internal iliac vein.
