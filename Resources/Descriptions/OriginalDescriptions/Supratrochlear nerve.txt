SUPRATROCHLEAR NERVE


The supratrochlear nerve is a branch of the frontal nerve, itself a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1) from the trigeminal nerve (CN V). 

It provides sensory innervation to the skin of the forehead and the upper eyelid.


== Structure ==

The supratrochlear nerve is a branch of the frontal nerve, itself a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1) from the trigeminal nerve (CN V). 

It is smaller than the supraorbital nerve from the frontal nerve. 

It branches midway between the base and apex of the orbit. 

It passes above the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle. 

It then travels anteriorly above the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. 

It exits the orbit through the frontal notch in the superomedial margin of the orbit. 

It then ascends onto the forehead beneath the corrugator supercilii muscle and frontalis muscle. 

It then divides into sensory branches.
The supratrochlear nerve travels with the supratrochlear artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery.


== Function ==

The supratrochlear nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral lower forehead, upper eyelid, and the conjunctiva. 

It may also supply sensation to the periosteum of part of the frontal bone of the skull.


== Clinical significance ==

The supratrochlear nerve may be anaesthetised for surgery of parts of the scalp. 

This can be used for small lesions of the scalp. 

It can also be used for more extensive injury to the scalp. 

It is often anaesthetised alongside the supraorbital artery.


== Etymology ==

The supratrochlear nerve is named for its passage above the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle.
