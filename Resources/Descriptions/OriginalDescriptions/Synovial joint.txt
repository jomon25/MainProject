SYNOVIAL JOINT


A synovial joint, also known as diarthrosis, joins bones or cartilage with a fibrous joint capsule that is continuous with the periosteum of the joined bones, constitutes the outer boundary of a synovial cavity, and surrounds the bones' articulating surfaces. 

This joint unites long bones and permits free bone movement and greater mobility. 

The synovial cavity/joint is filled with synovial fluid. 

The joint capsule is made up of an outer layer, the articular capsule, which keeps the bones together structurally, and an inner layer, the synovial membrane, which seals in the synovial fluid.

They are the most common and most movable type of joint in the body of a mammal. 

As with most other joints, synovial joints achieve movement at the point of contact of the articulating bones.


== Structure ==

Synovial joints contain the following structures:

-Synovial cavity
-Joint capsule
-Articular cartilage
-Articular discs or menisci 
-Articular fat pads 
-Tendons
-Accessory ligaments (extracapsular and intracapsular)
-Bursae 


=== Blood supply ===

The blood supply of a synovial joint is derived from the arteries sharing in the anastomosis around the joint.


=== Types ===

There are eight types of synovial joints. 

Some are relatively immobile, but are more stable. 

Others have multiple degrees of freedom, but at the expense of greater risk of injury. 

In ascending order of mobility, they are:
    
-Simple joint
-Complex joint
-Plane joint
-Cylindrical joints
-Bicondylar joint
-Saddle joint
-Ellipsoid joint
-Ball and socket joint
