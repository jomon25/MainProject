CREMASTERIC ARTERY


The cremasteric artery (external spermatic artery) is a branch of the inferior epigastric artery which accompanies the spermatic cord, and supplies the cremaster muscle and other coverings of the cord, anastomosing with the testicular artery (internal spermatic artery in older texts). 

In the female, the cremasteric artery is very small and accompanies the round ligament.
