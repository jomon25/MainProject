TRANSVERSE LIGAMENT TUBERCLE


Just below the medial margin of each superior facet is a small tubercle, for the attachment of the transverse atlantal ligament which stretches across the ring of the atlas and divides the vertebral foramen into two unequal parts:

    the anterior or smaller receiving the odontoid process of the axis
    the posterior transmitting the spinal cord (medulla spinalis) and its membranes
