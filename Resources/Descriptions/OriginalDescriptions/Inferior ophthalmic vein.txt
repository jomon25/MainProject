INFERIOR OPHTHALMIC VEIN


The inferior ophthalmic vein is a vein of the orbit around the eye. 

It receives veins from many structures. 

It divides into two branches, one of which ends in the pterygoid plexus through the inferior orbital fissure, and the other which ends in the cavernous sinus through the superior orbital fissure. 

It drains blood from the inferior rectus muscle, the inferior oblique muscle, the lateral rectus muscle, the inferior conjunctiva, and the lacrimal sac. 

It can be affected in periorbital cellulitis.


== Structure ==

The inferior ophthalmic vein begins in a venous network at the anterior floor and medial wall of the orbit. 

It receives some vorticose veins, and other veins from the inferior rectus muscle, the inferior oblique muscle, the lateral rectus muscle, the lacrimal sac, and the conjunctiva. 

It runs backward in the lower part of the orbit, lying above the inferior rectus muscle.
The inferior ophthalmic vein divides into two branches. 

One branch passes through the inferior orbital fissure, and joins the pterygoid venous plexus. 

The other branch enters the skull through the superior orbital fissure, and ends in the cavernous sinus. 

It drains either by a separate opening, or more frequently by merging with the superior ophthalmic vein.


== Function ==

The inferior ophthalmic vein drains the orbit. 

It drains blood from the inferior rectus muscle, the inferior oblique muscle, the lateral rectus muscle, the inferior conjunctiva, and the lacrimal sac. 

The superior ophthalmic vein also helps to drain the orbit.


== Clinical significance ==

In periorbital cellulitis, the inferior ophthalmic vein may be compressed. 

This can increase pressure, causing oedema.
