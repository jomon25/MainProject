(INTERPARIETAL BONE)


An interparietal bone (os interparietale or Inca bone or os Inca. Var.) is a dermal bone situated between the parietal and supraoccipital. 

It is homologous to the postparietal bones of other animals.

In humans, it corresponds to the upper portion of the squama of the occipital bone that lies superior to the highest nuchal line and is completely fused to the supraoccipital. 

However, in some individuals this portion remains separate from the rest of the occipital bone throughout life.
