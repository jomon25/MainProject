IRIS SPHINCTER MUSCLE


The iris sphincter muscle (pupillary sphincter, pupillary constrictor, circular muscle of iris, circular fibers) is a muscle in the part of the eye called the iris. 

It encircles the pupil of the iris, appropriate to its function as a constrictor of the pupil.


== Comparative anatomy ==

This structure is found in vertebrates and in some cephalopods.


== General structure ==

All the myocytes are of the smooth muscle type.Its dimensions are about 0.75 mm wide by 0.15 mm thick.


== Mode of action ==

In humans, it functions to constrict the pupil in bright light (pupillary light reflex) or during accommodation. 

In lower animals, the muscle cells themselves are photosensitive causing iris action without brain input.


== Innervation ==

It is controlled by parasympathetic fibers of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3) that originate from the Edingerâ€“Westphal nucleus, travel along the oculomotor nerve (CN III), synapse in the ciliary ganglion, and then enter the eye through the short ciliary nerves.. 

The short ciliary nerves then run forward and pierce the sclera at the back of the eye, traveling between the sclera and the choroid to innervate the iris sphincter muscle.
