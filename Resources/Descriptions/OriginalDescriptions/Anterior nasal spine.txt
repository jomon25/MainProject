ANTERIOR NASAL SPINE


The anterior nasal spine, or anterior nasal spine of maxilla, is a bony projection in the skull that serves as a cephalometric landmark. 

The anterior nasal spine is the projection formed by the fusion of the two maxillary bones at the intermaxillary suture. 

It is placed at the level of the nostrils, at the uppermost part of the philtrum and rarely fractures.
