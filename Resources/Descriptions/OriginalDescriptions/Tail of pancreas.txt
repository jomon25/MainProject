TAIL OF PANCREAS


The pancreas narrows towards the tail, which sits near to the spleen.

It is usually between 1.3–3.5 cm (0.51–1.38 in) long, and sits between the layers of the ligament between the spleen and the left kidney. 

The splenic artery and vein, which also passes behind the body of the pancreas, pass behind the tail of the pancreas.
