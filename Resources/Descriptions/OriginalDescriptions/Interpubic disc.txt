INTERPUBIC DISC


The disc of fibrocartilage that unites the pubic bones of the coxal bones at the pubic symphysis, closing the pelvic girdle.

The pubic symphysis is a nonsynovial amphiarthrodial joint. 

The width of the pubic symphysis at the front is 3â€“5 mm greater than its width at the back. 

This joint is connected by fibrocartilage and may contain a fluid-filled cavity; the center is avascular, possibly due to the nature of the compressive forces passing through this joint, which may lead to harmful vascular disease.

The ends of both pubic bones are covered by a thin layer of hyaline cartilage attached to the fibrocartilage. 

The fibrocartilaginous disk is reinforced by a series of ligaments. 

These ligaments cling to the fibrocartilaginous disk to the point that fibers intermix with it.
