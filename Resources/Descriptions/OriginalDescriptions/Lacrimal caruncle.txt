LACRIMAL CARUNCLE


The lacrimal caruncle, or caruncula lacrimalis, is the small, pink, globular nodule at the inner corner (the medial canthus) of the eye. 

It consists of tissue types of neighbouring eye structures. 

It may suffer from lesions and allergic inflammation.


== Structure ==

The lacrimal caruncle is found at the medial canthus of the eye. 

It consists of skin, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, accessory lacrimal tissue and other tissues that are present in the skin and accessory lacrimal glands. 

Its non-keratinized epithelium resembles the conjunctival epithelium.


== Clinical significance ==



=== Lesions ===

The lacrimal caruncle may have a lesion. 

This can have any one of a number of causes, which may be difficult to diagnose. 

Cancer is a rare cause. 

These lesions include papillomas and oncocytomas.


=== Allergies ===

With ocular allergies, the lacrimal caruncle and the plica semilunaris of the conjunctiva may be inflamed and pruritic (itchy) due to histamine release in the tissue and tear film.
