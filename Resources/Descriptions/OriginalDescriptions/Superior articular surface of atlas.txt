SUPERIOR ARTICULAR SURFACE OF ATLAS


The superior facets of the lateral masses of atlas(C1) are of large size, oval, concave, and approach each other in front, but diverge behind: 
    
    they are directed upward, medially, and a little backward, each forming a cup for the corresponding condyle of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. 
    
    Not infrequently they are partially subdivided by indentations which encroach upon their margins.
