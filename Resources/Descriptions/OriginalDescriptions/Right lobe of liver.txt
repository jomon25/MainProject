RIGHT LOBE OF LIVER


The liver is grossly divided into two parts when viewed from above – a right lobe and a left lobe - and four parts when viewed from below (left, right, caudate, and quadrate lobes).

The right lobe is six times the size of the left lobe. 

It occupies the right hypochondrium, on its posterior surface by the ligamentum venosum for the cranial (upper) half and by the ligamentum teres hepatis (Round ligament of liver) for the caudal (under) half. 

The ligamentum teres hepatis turns around the inferior margin of the liver to come out ventral in the falciform ligament.

The right lobe is functionally separated from the left lobe by the middle hepatic vein. 

From a functional perspective (one that takes the arterial, portal venous, and systemic venous anatomy into account) the falciform ligament separates the medial and lateral segments of the left hepatic lobe.

The right lobe is of a somewhat quadrilateral form. 

Its under and posterior surfaces being marked by three fossæ: 
    
    the fossa for the portal vein, the fossa for the gall-bladder and the fossae for the inferior vena cava. 

These separate the right lobe into two smaller lobes on its left posterior part: 
    
    the quadrate lobe and the caudate lobe. 
    
    
Segments V to VIII make up the right part of the liver:

    -Segment V is the most medial and inferior
    -Segment VI is located more posteriorly
    -Segment VII is located above segment VI
    -Segment VIII sits above segment V in the superio-medial position
