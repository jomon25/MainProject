LIMEN NASI


A mucous ridge known as the limen nasi separates the vestibule from the rest of the nasal cavity and marks the change from the skin of the vestibule to the respiratory epithelium of the rest of the nasal cavity.

This area is also known as a mucocutaneous junction and has a dense microvasculature.
