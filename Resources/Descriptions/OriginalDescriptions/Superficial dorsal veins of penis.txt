SUPERFICIAL DORSAL VEINS OF PENIS


The superficial dorsal veins of the penis drain the prepuce and skin of the penis, and, running backward in the subcutaneous tissue, inclines to the right or left, and opens into the corresponding superficial external pudendal vein, a tributary of the great saphenous vein.

In contrast to the deep dorsal vein, it lies outside Buck's fascia.

It is possible for the vein to rupture, which presents in a manner similar to penile fracture.
