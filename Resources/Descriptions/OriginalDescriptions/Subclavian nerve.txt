SUBCLAVIAN NERVE


The subclavian nerve, also known as the nerve to the subclavius, is small branch of the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. 

It contains axons from C5 and C6. 

The subclavian nerve innervates the subclavius muscle. 


== Structure ==

The subclavian nerve is a branch of the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. 

It contains axons derived from the ventral rami of the C5 and C6 cervical spinal nerves.


=== Variation ===

The subclavian nerve can variably give rise to a branch which innervates the diaphragm called the accessory phrenic nerve. 

The accessory phrenic nerve may rather branch from the ansa cervicalis. 

This nerve usually joins with the phrenic nerve before innervating the diaphragm.


== Function ==

The subclavian nerve innervates the subclavius muscle.
