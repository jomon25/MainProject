SYNOVIAL JOINTS OF PELVIC GIRDLE


A synovial joint, also known as diarthrosis, joins bones or cartilage with a fibrous joint capsule that is continuous with the periosteum of the joined bones, constitutes the outer boundary of a synovial cavity, and surrounds the bones' articulating surfaces. 

Within the Pelvic girdle, the only synovial joint is the sacro-iliac joint.
