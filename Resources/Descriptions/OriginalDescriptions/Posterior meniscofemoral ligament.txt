POSTERIOR MENISCOFEMORAL LIGAMENT


The Posterior meniscofemoral ligament (also known as the ligament of Wrisberg) is a small fibrous band of the knee joint. 

It attaches to the posterior area of the lateral meniscus and crosses superiorly and medially behind the posterior cruciate ligament to attach to the medial condyle of the femur.
It forms with articulatio meniscolateralis anterior articulatio mesicofemoralis which is the upper floor of articulatio genus. 

It flexes and extends functionally as ginglymus with frontal axis.
