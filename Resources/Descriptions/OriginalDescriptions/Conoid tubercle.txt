CONOID TUBERCLE


On the inferior surface of the lateral part of the clavicle, the conoid ligament, which is the posterior and medial fasciculus of the coracoclavicular ligament, is attached by its expanded base, to the conoid tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle, and to a line proceeding medialward from it for 1.25 cm.

(Its apex then reaches a rough impression at the base of the coracoid process on the scapula, medial to the trapezoid ligament.)
