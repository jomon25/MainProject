CREST OF HEAD OF RIB


The ribs connect to the vertebrae with two costovertebral joints, one on the head and one on the neck. 

The head of the rib has a superior and an inferior articulating region, separated by a crest. 

These articulate with the superior and inferior costal facets on the connecting vertebrae.

The crest gives attachment to the intra-articulate ligament that joins the rib to the vertebra of the same number, at the intervertebral disc.
