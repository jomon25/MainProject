ARTICULAR DISC OF DISTAL RADIO-ULNAR JOINT


The radiocarpal joint or wrist joint is an ellipsoid joint formed by the radius and the triangular articular disc proximally and the proximal row of carpal bones distally. 

On the other hand, the distal articular surface is made up of proximal surfaces of the scaphoid, triquetral and lunate bones.
