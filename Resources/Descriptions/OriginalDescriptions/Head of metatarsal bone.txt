HEAD OF METATARSAL BONE


The head or distal extremity presents a convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward below than above. 

Its sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. 

Its plantar surface is grooved antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.
