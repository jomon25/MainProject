GREATER PALATINE NERVE


The greater palatine nerve (anterior palatine nerve) is a branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion. 

It carries both general sensory fibres from the maxillary nerve, and parasympathetic fibers from the nerve of the pterygoid canal. 

It may be anaesthetised for procedures of the mouth and maxillary (upper) teeth.


== Structure ==

The greater palatine nerve is a branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion. 

It descends through the greater palatine canal, moving anteriorly and inferiorly. 

Here, it is accompanied by the descending palatine artery. 

It emerges upon the hard palate through the greater palatine foramen. 

It then passes forward in a groove in the hard palate, nearly as far as the incisor teeth.
While in the pterygopalatine canal, it gives off lateral posterior inferior nasal branches, which enter the nasal cavity through openings in the palatine bone, and ramify over the inferior nasal concha and middle and inferior meatuses. 

At its exit from the canal, a palatine branch is distributed to both surfaces of the soft palate.


== Function ==

The greater palatine nerve carries both general sensory fibres from the maxillary nerve, and parasympathetic fibers from the nerve of the pterygoid canal. 

It supplies the gums, the mucous membrane and glands of the hard palate, and communicates in front with the terminal filaments of the nasopalatine nerve.


== Clinical significance ==

The greater palatine nerve may be anaesthetised to perform dental procedures on the maxillary (upper) teeth, and sometimes for cleft lip and cleft palate surgery.


== History ==

The greater palatine nerve may also be known as the anterior palatine nerve. 

This refers to its position in relation to the lesser palatine nerve, which is posterior to it.
