INCISIVE FORAMEN


In the human mouth, the incisive foramen, also called anterior palatine foramen, or nasopalatine foramen, is a funnel-shaped opening in the bone of the oral hard palate. 

It is immediately behind the incisor teeth. 

The incisive foramen is continuous with the incisive canal, located behind the central incisor teeth in the incisive fossa of the maxilla. 

It allows for blood vessels and nerves to pass. 

It is also used as a landmark for defining the severity of cleft lip and cleft palate. 

It can be found in a variety of species.


== Structure ==

The incisive foramen is a funnel-shaped opening in the bone of the oral hard palate. 

It is immediately behind the incisor teeth. 

It is also between the premaxillae on each side. 

It is continuous with the incisive canal, located behind the central incisor teeth in the incisive fossa of the maxilla.


== Function ==

The incisive foramen allows for blood vessels and nerves to pass. 

These include:

the pterygoopalatine nerves to the hard palate.
the nasopalatine nerves from the floor of the nasal cavity.
the sopalatine branches of the infratrochlear nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (V1), itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve.
the sphenopalatine artery supplying the mucous membrane covering the hard palate of the mouth.
the sphenopalatine vein draining the mucous membrane covering the hard palate of the mouth.


== Clinical significance ==

As many nerves exit the incisive canal at the incisive foramen, it may be used for injection of local anaesthetic.When plain radiographs are taken of the mouth, the incisive foramen may be mistaken for a periapical lesion.The incisive foramen can be used as a landmark when describing cleft lip and cleft palate, which can either extend in front of (primary) or behind (secondary) the foramen. 

It is also important as a surgical landmark to avoid damaging its nerves and vascular structures.


== History ==

The incisive foramen is also known as the anterior palatine foramen, the nasopalatine foramen, and the incisive fossa.


== Other animals ==

In many other species, the incisive foramina allow for passage of ducts to the vomeronasal organ. 

It can be found in cats, and alligators.
