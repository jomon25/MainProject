DORSAL NASAL ARTERY


The dorsal nasal artery is an artery of the face. 

It is one of two terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery. 

It supplies the lacrimal sac, and sometimes supplies the tip of the nose. 

It is an important anastomosis with the facial artery through its terminal (angular) branch.


== Structure ==

The dorsal nasal artery is a terminal branch of the ophthalmic artery in the superomedial orbit (the other artery is the supratrochlear artery). 

It passes anteriorly to exit the orbit between the trochlea superiorly and the medial palpebral ligament inferiorly. 

First, it gives a branch to the lacrimal sac. 

Then it bifurcates into a branch that anastomoses with the terminal (angular) part of the facial artery and a branch that travels along the dorsum of the nose. 

This latter branch also anastomoses with its contralateral pair and the lateral nasal branch of the facial artery.


== Function ==

The dorsal nasal artery supplies the lacrimal sac. 

In around 20% of people, it also supplies the tip of the nose. 

Its anastomosis with the end of the facial artery is important for blood supply of the face.
