COCCYGEAL HORN


The coccygeal horns are the superior pair of tubercles, placed in lateral vertical linear rows on the posterior surface of the coccyx

These tubercles are the rudimentary articular processes of the coccygeal vertebrae. 

The superior pair are the largest; they project upward, and articulate with the sacral horns, and on either side complete the foramen for the transmission of the posterior division of the fifth sacral nerve.
