METATARSOPHALANGEAL JOINTS


The metatarsophalangeal joints (MTP joints), also informally known as toe knuckles, are the joints between the metatarsal bones of the foot and the proximal bones (proximal phalanges) of the toes. 

They are condyloid joints, meaning that an elliptical or rounded surface (of the metatarsal bones) comes close to a shallow cavity (of the proximal phalanges).
The ligaments are the plantar and two collateral.


== Movements ==

The movements permitted in the metatarsophalangeal joints are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction and circumduction.
