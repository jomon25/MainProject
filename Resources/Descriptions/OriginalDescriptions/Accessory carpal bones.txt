ACCESSORY CARPAL BONES


Occasionally accessory bones are found in the carpus, but of more than 20 such described bones, only four (the central, styloid, secondary trapezoid, and secondary pisiform bones) are considered to be proven accessory bones. 

Sometimes the scaphoid, triquetrum, and pisiform bones are divided into two.
