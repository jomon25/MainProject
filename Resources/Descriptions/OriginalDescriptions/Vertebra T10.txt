TENTH THORACIC VERTEBRA


The tenth thoracic vertebra has an entire articular facet (not demi-facet) on either side, which is placed partly on the lateral surface of the pedicle. 

It doesn't have any kind of facet below, because the following ribs only have one facet on their heads.

The thoracic spinal nerve 10 (T10) passes out underneath it. 

See: thoracic vertebrae.
