POSTERIOR TUBERCLE OF TRANSVERSE PROCESS


Each transverse process of the cervical vertebrae consists of an anterior and a posterior part.

These two parts are joined, outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.


    The posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the vertebral arch behind the foramen and is directed forward and laterally; it ends in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.
