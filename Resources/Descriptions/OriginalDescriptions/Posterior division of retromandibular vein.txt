POSTERIOR DIVISION OF RETROMANDIBULAR VEIN


The retromandibular vein (temporomaxillary vein, posterior facial vein) is a major vein of the face. 


==Structure==

The retromandibular vein is formed by the union of the superficial temporal and maxillary veins.

It descends in the substance of the parotid gland, superficial to the external carotid artery (but beneath the facial nerve), between the ramus of the mandible and the sternocleidomastoideus muscle.

It divides into two branches:

    an anterior, which passes forward and joins anterior facial vein, to form the common facial vein, which then drains into the internal jugular vein.

    a posterior, which is joined by the posterior auricular vein and becomes the external jugular vein.

==Function==

The retromandibular vein provides venous drainage to the superior cranium, and significant drainage to the ear.
