ANTERIOR DIVISION OF MANDIBULAR NERVE


The mandibular nerve divides into a small anterior and large posterior trunk after passing between tensor veli palatini, which is medial, and lateral pterygoid, which is lateral, and giving off a meningeal branch (nervus spinosus) and the nerve to medial pterygoid from its medial side.

The anterior division gives off branches to three major muscles of mastication and a buccal branch which is sensory to the cheek:
    
-the nerve to medial pterygoid muscle,
-the nerve to tensor veli palatini,
-the nerve to tensor tympani,
-the masseteric nerve,
-the deep temporal nerves,
-the nerve to lateral pterygoid muscle,
-and the buccal nerve
