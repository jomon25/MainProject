MUSCLES OF SOFT PALATE


The five muscles of the soft palate play important roles in swallowing and breathing. 

The muscles are:

    -Tensor veli palatini, which is involved in swallowing
    -Palatoglossus, involved in swallowing
    -Palatopharyngeus, involved in breathing
    -Levator veli palatini, involved in swallowing
    -Musculus uvulae, which moves the uvula

These muscles are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus via the vagus nerve, with the exception of the tensor veli palatini. 

The tensor veli palatini is innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3).
