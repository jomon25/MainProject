SYNOVIAL FLUID


Synovial fluid, also called synovia, is a viscous, non-Newtonian fluid found in the cavities of synovial joints. 

With its egg whiteâ€“like consistency, the principal role of synovial fluid is to reduce friction between the articular cartilage of synovial joints during movement.

Synovial fluid is a small component of the transcellular fluid component of extracellular fluid.
