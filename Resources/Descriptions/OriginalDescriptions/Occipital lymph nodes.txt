OCCIPITAL LYMPH NODES


The occipital lymph nodes, one to three in number, are located on the back of the head close to the margin of the trapezius and resting on the insertion of the semispinalis capitis.
Their afferent vessels drain the occipital region of the scalp, while their efferents pass to the superior deep cervical glands.
