CAVITY OF BONY PELVIS


The pelvic cavity is a body cavity that is bounded by the bones of the pelvis and which primarily contains reproductive organs and the rectum.

A distinction is made between the lesser or true pelvis inferior to the terminal line, and the greater or false pelvis above it. 

The pelvic inlet or superior pelvic aperture, which leads into the lesser pelvis, is bordered by the promontory, the arcuate line of ilium, the iliopubic eminence, the pecten of the pubis, and the upper part of the pubic symphysis. 

The pelvic outlet or inferior pelvic aperture is the region between the subpubic angle or pubic arch, the ischial tuberosities and the coccyx.

    Ligaments: 
        
-obturator membrane, 
-inguinal ligament (lacunar ligament, iliopectineal arch)

Alternatively, the pelvis is divided into three planes: the inlet, midplane, and outlet.
