(THIRD TROCHANTER)


In human anatomy, the third trochanter is a bony projection occasionally present on the proximal femur near the superior border of the gluteal tuberosity. 

When present, it is oblong, rounded, or conical in shape and sometimes continuous with the gluteal ridge. 

Structures analogous to the third trochanter are present in other mammals, including some primates.

It is called the third trochanter in reference to the greater and lesser trochanters that are always present on the femur.

Its function is to provide an attachment for the ascending tendon of the gluteus maximus muscle.
