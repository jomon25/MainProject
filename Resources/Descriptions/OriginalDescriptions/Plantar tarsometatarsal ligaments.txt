PLANTAR TARSOMETATARSAL LIGAMENTS


The plantar tarsometatarsal ligaments consist of longitudinal and oblique bands, disposed with less regularity than the dorsal ligaments.
Those for the first and second metatarsals are the strongest; the second and third metatarsals are joined by oblique bands to the first cuneiform; the fourth and fifth metatarsals are connected by a few fibers to the cuboid.
