AMPULLA OF VAS DEFERENS


The ampulla of vas deferens, also called the ampulla of ductus deferens, is an enlargement of the vas deferens at the fundus of the bladder which acts as a reservoir for sperm. 

This structure is seen in some mammalian and squamate species and is sometimes tortuous in shape.
