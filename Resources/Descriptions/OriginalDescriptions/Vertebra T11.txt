ELEVENTH THORACIC VERTEBRAE


In the eleventh thoracic vertebra the body approaches in its form and size to that of the lumbar vertebrae.

The articular facets for the heads of the ribs are of medium size, and placed chiefly on the pedicles, which are thicker and stronger in this and the next vertebra than in any other part of the thoracic region.

The spinous process is short, and nearly horizontal in direction.

The transverse processes are very short, tuberculated at their extremities, and do not have articular facets.

The thoracic spinal nerve 11 (T11) passes out underneath it. 

See: thoracic vertebrae.
