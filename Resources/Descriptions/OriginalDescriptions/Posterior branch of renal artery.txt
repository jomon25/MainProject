POSTERIOR BRANCH OF RENAL ARTERY


Before reaching the hilus of the kidney, each artery divides into four or five branches. 

The anterior branches (the upper, middle, lower and apical segmental arteries) lie between the renal vein and ureter, the vein being in front, the ureter behind. 

The posterior branches, which are fewer in number and include the posterior segmental artery, are usually situated behind the ureter.
