ABDOMINAL WALL


In anatomy, the abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. 

The abdominal wall is split into the anterolateral and posterior walls.There is a common set of layers covering and forming all the walls: the deepest being the visceral peritoneum, which covers many of the abdominal organs (most of the large and small intestines, for example), and the parietal peritoneum- which covers the visceral peritoneum below it, the extraperitoneal fat, the transversalis fascia, the internal and external oblique and transversus abdominis aponeurosis, and a layer of fascia, which has different names according to what it covers (e.g., transversalis, psoas fascia).In medical vernacular, the term 'abdominal wall' most commonly refers to the layers composing the anterior abdominal wall which, in addition to the layers mentioned above, includes the three layers of muscle: the transversus abdominis (transverse abdominal muscle), the internal (obliquus internus) and the external oblique (obliquus externus).


== Layers of anterolateral abdominal wall ==

In human anatomy, the layers of the anterolateral abdominal wall are (from superficial to deep):
Skin
Subcutaneous tissue
Fascia
Camper's fascia - fatty superficial layer.
Scarpa's fascia - deep fibrous layer.
Superficial Abdominal fascia
Muscle
External oblique abdominal muscle
Internal oblique abdominal muscle
Rectus abdominis
Transverse abdominal muscle
Pyramidalis muscle
Transversalis fascia
Extraperitoneal fat
Peritoneum


== Inner surface ==

The surface contains several ligaments separated by fossae:
