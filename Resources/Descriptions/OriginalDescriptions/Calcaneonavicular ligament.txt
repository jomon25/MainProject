CALCANEONAVICULAR LIGAMENT


The calcaneonavicular ligament is the upper of two parts of the bifurcate ligament that is divided in front in a Y-shaped manner into a calcaneocuboid ligament and a calcaneonavicular part.

They are both attached behind to the deep hollow on the upper surface of the calcaneus, but the calcaneonavicular ligament is attached to the lateral side of the navicular. 

(Note this is NOT the spring ligament which is commonly called the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament).

It is commonly injured in "sprain-type" inversion injuries producing an avulsion fracture at the anterolateral process of the calcaneus.
