RIGHT SUPERIOR LOBAR BRONCHUS


The eparterial bronchus (right superior lobar bronchus) is a branch of the right main bronchus given off about 2.5 cm from the bifurcation of the trachea.

This branch supplies the superior lobe of the right lung and is the most superior of all secondary bronchi. 

It arises above the level of the right pulmonary artery, and for this reason is named the eparterial bronchus.

All other distributions falling below the pulmonary artery are termed hyparterial.

The eparterial bronchus is the only secondary bronchus with a specific name apart from the name of its corresponding lobe.
