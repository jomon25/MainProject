BODY OF PANCREAS


The body is the largest part of the pancreas, and mostly lies behind the stomach, tapering along its length. 

The peritoneum sits on top of the body of the pancreas, and the transverse colon in front of the peritoneum.

Behind the pancreas are several blood vessels, including the aorta, the splenic vein, and the left renal vein, as well as the beginning of the superior mesenteric artery.

Below the body of the pancreas sits some of the small intestine, specifically the last part of the duodenum and the jejunum to which it connects, as well as the suspensory ligament of the duodenum which falls between these two. 

In front of the pancreas sits the transverse colon.
