LATERAL PATELLAR RETINACULUM


The lateral retinaculum is the fibrous tissue on the lateral (outer) side of the kneecap (patella). 

The kneecap has both a medial (on the inner aspect) and a lateral (on the outer side) retinaculum, and these help to support the kneecap in its position in relation to the femur bone underneath it.
