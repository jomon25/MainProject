SYNOVIAL JOINTS OF LARYNX


Although most joints of the larynx are fibrous joints (made of ligaments) the cricothyroid joint, that articulates the cricoid cartilage to the thyroid cartilage, and the crico-arytenoid joint, that articulates the arytenoid cartilages to the cricoid cartilage, are synovial joints.
