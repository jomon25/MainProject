GASTROSPLENIC LIGAMENT


The gastrosplenic ligament (also known as the ligamentum gastrosplenicum or gastrolienal ligament) is part of the greater omentum.


== Structure ==

The gastrosplenic ligament is made of visceral peritoneum. 

It connects the greater curvature of stomach with the hilum of the spleen.It contains the short gastric arteries, short gastric veins, the left gastroepiploic artery, and the left gastroepiploic vein.


=== Development ===

Embryonically, the gastrosplenic ligament is derived from the dorsal mesogastrium.


== Clinical significance ==



=== Gastrosplenic ligament entrapment ===

Small intestine may loop through a perforation in the gastrosplenic ligament, ending lateral to the spleen and stomach. 

This is known as gastrosplenic ligament entrapment, and is usually caused by abdominal trauma. 

This is corrected with surgery.
