LEFT LOBE OF LIVER


The left lobe is smaller and more flattened than the right. 

It is situated in the epigastric, and left hypochondriac regions of the abdomen. 

Its upper surface is slightly convex and is moulded on to the diaphragm; its under surface presents the gastric impression and omental tuberosity. 

Segments II and III lie medial to the falciform ligament with II superior to the portal venous supply and III inferior. 

Segment IV lies lateral to the falciform ligament and is subdivided into IVa (superior) and IVb (inferior).
