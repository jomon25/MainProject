YELLOW BONE MARROW


The function of yellow bone marrow is to store fat and produce red blood cells during life-threatening situations. 

During serious emergencies, our body can experience rapid blood loss. 

Yellow bone marrow essentially transforms into red bone marrow during life-threatening events to produce blood cells and keep us alive.

It also aids with the production of fat, bone and cartilage. 

Importantly, it helps with the storage of fats in cells, known as adipocytes, which helps provide sustenance for bones to function.

Bone marrow stays red until the age of seven. 

As we age, about half of red bone marrow is slowly replaced by yellow bone marrow. 

Adults have an average of 5.7 pounds of red bone marrow.
Where is yellow bone marrow found?

Yellow bone marrow is located in the hollow cavity of long bones. 

It is typically found at the center surrounded by red bone marrow.
