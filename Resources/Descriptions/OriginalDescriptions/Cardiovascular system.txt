CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
/CIRCULATORY SYSTEM


The circulatory system includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood. 

The cardiovascular system in all vertebrates, consists of the heart and blood vessels. 

The circulatory system is further divided into two major circuits – a pulmonary circulation, and a systemic circulation. 

The pulmonary circulation is a circuit loop from the right heart taking deoxygenated blood to the lungs where it is oxygenated and returned to the left heart. 

The systemic circulation is a circuit loop that delivers oxygenated blood from the left heart to the rest of the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the right heart via large veins known as the venae cavae. 

The systemic circulation can also be defined as two parts – a macrocirculation and a microcirculation. 

An average adult contains five to six quarts (roughly 4.7 to 5.7 liters) of blood, accounting for approximately 7% of their total body weight.
