POSTERIOR CORD OF BRACHIAL PLEXUS


The posterior cord is a part of the infraclavicular part of brachial plexus.

It consists of contributions from all of the roots of the brachial plexus.

The posterior cord gives rise to the following nerves:

-The upper subscapular nerve
 	Roots: C5-C6 	
    Supplies: subscapularis muscle of the rotator cuff
    
-The lower subscapular nerve
 	Roots: C5-C6 
    Supplies: subscapularis muscle, teres major muscle

-The thoracodorsal nerve
 	Roots: C6-C8
  	Supplies: latissimus dorsi muscle

-The axillary nerve
 	Roots: C5-C6
  	Supplies: sensation to the shoulder and motor to the deltoid muscle, the teres minor and the triceps brachii (long head) muscle

-The radial nerve
 	Roots: C5-C8, T1
  	Supplies: triceps brachii muscle, the brachioradialis muscle, the extensor muscles of the fingers and wrist (extensor carpi radialis muscle), supinator, and the extensor and abductor muscles of the thumb.
