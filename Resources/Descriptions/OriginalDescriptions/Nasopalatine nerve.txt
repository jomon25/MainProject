NASOPALATINE NERVE


The nasopalatine nerve (long sphenopalatine nerve) is a nerve of the head. 

It is a branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion, a continuation from the maxillary nerve (V2). 

It supplies the structures of the palate, and partially supplies the nasal septum.


== Structure ==

The nasopalatine nerve is a branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion, a continuation from the maxillary nerve (V2), itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve. 

It enters the nasal cavity through the sphenopalatine foramen. 

It passes across the roof of the nasal cavity below the orifice of the sphenoidal sinus to reach the nasal septum. 

It then runs obliquely downward and forward between the periosteum and mucous membrane of the lower part of the nasal septum. 

It descends to the roof of the mouth through the incisive canal to the hard palate.The nasopalatine nerve communicates with the corresponding nerve of the opposite side and with the greater palatine nerve.


== Function ==

The nasopalatine nerve supplies the anterior structures of the palate. 

It also partially supplies the mucous membrane of the nasal septum.The medial superior posterior nasal branches of the maxillary nerve usually branch from the nasopalatine nerve.


== Clinical significance ==

The nasopalatine nerve may be anaesthetised in order to performs surgery on the hard palate or the soft palate.


== History ==

The nasopalatine nerve was first identified by Domenico Cotugno.
