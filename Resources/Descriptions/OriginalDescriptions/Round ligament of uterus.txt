ROUND LIGAMENT OF UTERUS


The round ligament of the uterus is a ligament that connects the uterus to the labia majora.


== Structure ==

The round ligament of the uterus originates at the uterine horns, in the parametrium. 

The round ligament exits the pelvis via the deep inguinal ring. 

It passes through the inguinal canal, and continues on to the labia majora. 

At the labia majora, its fibers spread and mix with the tissue of the mons pubis.


=== Development ===

The round ligament develops from the gubernaculum which attaches the gonad to the labioscrotal swellings in the embryo.


=== Blood supply ===

The round ligament is supplied by the artery of the round ligament, otherwise known as "Sampson's artery."


== Function ==

The function of the round ligament is maintenance of the anteversion of the uterus (a position where the fundus of the uterus is turned forward at the junction of cervix and vagina) during pregnancy. 

Normally, the cardinal ligament is what supports the uterine angle (angle of anteversion). 

When the uterus grows during pregnancy, the round ligaments can stretch causing pain.
