CYSTIC VEIN


When present the cystic vein drains the blood from the gall-bladder, and, accompanying the cystic duct, usually ends in the right branch of the portal vein. 

It is usually not present, and the blood drains via small veins in the gall-bladder bed directly to the parenchyma of the liver.
