MEDIAL UMBILICAL LIGAMENT


The medial umbilical ligament (or cord of umbilical artery, or obliterated umbilical artery) is a paired structure found in human anatomy. 

It is on the deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall, and is covered by the medial umbilical folds (plicae umbilicales mediales). 

It is different from the median umbilical ligament, a structure that represents the remnant of the embryonic urachus.


== Origins ==

It represents the remnant of the umbilical arteries, which serves no purpose in humans after birth, except for the initial part that becomes the adult superior vesical artery.
The occluded part of umbilical artery becomes the medial umbilical ligament postnatal.
The medial umbilical ligament arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery.


== Functions ==

It may be used as a landmark for surgeons performing laparoscopic procedures to help identify and avoid damaging the inferior epigastric arteries during port placement. 

Other than this, it has no purpose in an adult and it may be cut or damaged with impunity


== Relations ==

The supravesical fossa, and therefore a supravesical hernia, is medial to this structure. 

The medial inguinal fossa, and therefore a direct inguinal hernia, is lateral to it.
