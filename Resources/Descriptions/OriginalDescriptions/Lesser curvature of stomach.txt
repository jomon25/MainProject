LESSER CURVATURE OF STOMACH


Lesser curvature

The lesser curvature of the stomach forms the upper right or medial border of the stomach.


==Structure==

The lesser curvature of the stomach travels between the cardiac and pyloric orifices. 

It descends as a continuation of the right margin of the esophagus in front of the fibers of the right crus of the diaphragm, and then, turning to the right, it crosses the first lumbar vertebra and ends at the pylorus.

Nearer its pyloric than its cardiac end is a well-marked notch, the incisura angularis, which varies somewhat in position with the state of distension of the viscus; it serves to separate the stomach into a right and a left portion.

The lesser curvature gives attachment to the two layers of the hepatogastric ligament â€“ part of the lesser omentum, and between these two layers are the left gastric artery and the right gastric branch of the hepatic artery.
