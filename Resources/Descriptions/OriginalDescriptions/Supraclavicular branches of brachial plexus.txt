SUPRACLAVICULAR BRANCHES OF BRACHIAL PLEXUS


Individual nerves emerging from the supraclavicular part of brachial plexus:
    
-Muscular branches of brachial plexus
-Dorsal scapular nerve
-Long thoracic nerve
-Suprascapular nerve
-Subclavian nerve
-Accessory phrenic nerves

As they leave the neuronal 'highways' of the brachial plexus, these nerves are not described as part of the supraclavicular part of brachial plexus, or infraclavicular part of brachial plexus but as the supraclavicular branches of brachial plexus.
