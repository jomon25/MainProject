GONION


The forensic term for the midpoint of the mandibular angle is the gonion. 

The gonion is a cephalometric landmark located at the lowest, posterior, and lateral point on the angle.

This site is at the apex of the maximum curvature of the mandible, where the ascending ramus becomes the body of the mandible.
