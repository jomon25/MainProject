SPHINCTER OF PANCREATIC DUCT


(To be verified)

The major duodenal papilla is situated in the second part of the duodenum, 7â€“10 cm from the pylorus, at the level of the second or third lumbar vertebrae. 

It is surrounded by the sphincter of Oddi, a circular muscle, and receives a mixture of pancreatic enzymes and bile from the Ampulla of Vater, which drains both the pancreatic duct and biliary system.
