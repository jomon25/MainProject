CENTRAL LOBULE


The central lobule is a small square lobule, situated in the anterior cerebellar notch. 

It overlaps the lingula, from which it is separated by the precentral fissure; laterally, it extends along the upper and anterior part of each hemisphere, where it forms a wing-like prolongation (ala), on each side, as the alae of the central lobule or alae lobuli centralis.
