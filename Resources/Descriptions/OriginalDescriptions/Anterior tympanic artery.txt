ANTERIOR TYMPANIC ARTERY


The anterior tympanic artery (glaserian artery) is a small artery in the head that supplies the middle ear.
It usually arises as a branch of the first part of the maxillary artery. 

It passes upward behind the temporomandibular articulation, enters the tympanic cavity through the petrotympanic fissure, and ramifies upon the tympanic membrane, forming a vascular circle around the membrane with the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular, and anastomosing with the artery of the pterygoid canal and with the caroticotympanic branch from the internal carotid.
