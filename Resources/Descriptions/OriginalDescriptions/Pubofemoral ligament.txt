PUBOFEMORAL LIGAMENT


The pubofemoral ligament (pubocapsular ligament) is a ligament on the inferior side of the hip joint.
This ligament is attached, above, to the obturator crest and the superior ramus of the pubis; below, it blends with the capsule and with the deep surface of the vertical band of the iliofemoral ligament. 

This ligament prevents hyper-abduction of the hip joint.
