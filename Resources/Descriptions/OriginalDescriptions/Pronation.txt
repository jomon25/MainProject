PRONATION


Pronation at the forearm is a rotational movement where the hand and upper arm are turned so the thumbs point towards the body. 

When the forearm and hand are supinated, the thumbs point away from the body.

As an example, when a person is typing on a computer keyboard, their hands are pronated; when washing their face, they are supinated.
